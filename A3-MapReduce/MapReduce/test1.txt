This book is an introduction to semiconductor devices for undergraduate
electrical engineers, other interested students, and practicing engineers and
scientists whose understanding of modern electronics needs updating. The
book is organized to bring students with a background in sophomore physics
to a level of understanding that will allow them to read much of the current
literature on new devices and applications.
GOalS
what iS nEw in
thiS EDitiOn
An undergraduate course in electronic devices has two basic purposes:
(1) to provide students with a sound understanding of existing devices, so
that their studies of electronic circuits and systems will be meaningful and
(2) to develop the basic tools with which they can later learn about newly
developed devices and applications. Perhaps the second of these objectives
is the more important in the long run; it is clear that engineers and scientists
who deal with electronics will continually be called upon to learn about
new devices and processes in the future. For this reason, we have tried to
incorporate the basics of semiconductor materials and conduction processes
in solids, which arise repeatedly in the literature when new devices are
explained. Some of these concepts are often omitted in introductory courses,
with the view that they are unnecessary for understanding the fundamentals
of junctions and transistors. We believe this view neglects the important goal
of equipping students for the task of understanding a new device by reading
the current literature. Therefore, in this text most of the commonly used
semiconductor terms and concepts are introduced and related to a broad
range of devices.
	 •	 updated discussion of MOS devices, both in the underlying theory of
ballistic FETs as well as discussion of advanced MOSFETs such as
FinFETs, strained Si devices, metal gate/ high-k devices, III-V high
channel mobility devices
	 •	 updated treatment of optoelectronic devices, including high bandgap
nitride semiconductors and quantum cascade lasers
•	 brand new section on nanoelectronics to introduce students to exciting concepts such as 2D materials including graphene and topological insulators, 1D nanowires and nanotubes, and 0D quantum dots;
	 •	 discussion of spintronics, and novel resistive and phase change
memories
•	 about 100 new problems, and current references which extend concepts in the text.14 Preface
In presenting this material at the undergraduate level, one must anticipate
a few instances which call for a phrase such as “It can be shown . . .” This
is always disappointing; on the other hand, the alternative is to delay study
of solid state devices until the graduate level, where statistical mechanics,
quantum theory, and other advanced background can be freely invoked. Such
a delay would result in a more elegant treatment of certain subjects, but it
would prevent undergraduate students from enjoying the study of some very
exciting devices.
The discussion includes both silicon and compound semiconductors, to
reflect the continuing growth in importance for compounds in optoelectronic
and high-speed device applications. Topics such as heterojunctions, latticematching using ternary and quaternary alloys, variation of band gap with
alloy composition, and properties of quantum wells add to the breadth of
the discussion. Not to be outdone by the compounds, silicon-based devices
have continued their dramatic record of advancement. The discussion of FET
structures and Si integrated circuits reflects these advancements. Our objective is not to cover all the latest devices, which can only be done in the journal
and conference literature. Instead, we have chosen devices to discuss which
are broadly illustrative of important principles.
PrESEntatiOn
unitS In keeping with the goals described above, examples and problems are stated
in terms of units commonly used in the semiconductor literature. The basic
system of units is rationalized MKS, although cm is often used as a convenient unit of length. Similarly, electron volts (eV) are often used rather than
joules (J) to measure the energy of electrons. Units for various quantities are
given in Appendices I and II.
As a further aid in developing techniques for independent study, the reading
list at the end of each chapter includes a few articles which students can read
comfortably as they study this book. We do not expect that students will read
all articles recommended in the reading lists; nevertheless, some exposure to
periodicals is useful in laying the foundation for a career of constant updating and self-education. We have also added a summary of the key concepts
at the end of each chapter.
rEaDinG liStS
One of the keys to success in understanding this material is to work problems that exercise the concepts. The problems at the end of each chapter are
designed to facilitate learning the material. Very few are simple “plug-in”
problems. Instead, they are chosen to reinforce or extend the material presented in the chapter. In addition, we have added “self quiz” problems that
test the conceptual understanding on the part of the students.
PrOBlEMSPreface 15
The first four chapters of the book provide background on the nature of
semiconductors and conduction processes in solids (Chapters 3, 4). Included
is a brief introduction to quantum concepts (Chapter 2) for those students
who do not already have this background from other courses. Chapter 5
describes the p-n junction and some of its applications. Chapters 6 and 7 deal
with the principles of transistor operation. Chapter 8 covers optoelectronics,
and Chapter 9 discusses integrated circuits. Chapter 10 applies the theory of
junctions and conduction processes to microwave and power devices. A completely new section on nanoelectronics has been added. All of the devices
covered are important in today’s electronics; furthermore, learning about
these devices should be an enjoyable and rewarding experience. We hope
this book provides that kind of experience for its readers.

The seventh edition benefits greatly from comments and suggestions provided by students and teachers of the first six editions. The book’s readers
have generously provided comments which have been invaluable in developing the present version. We remain indebted to those persons mentioned
in the Preface of the first six editions, who contributed so much to the
development of the book. In particular, Nick Holonyak has been a source
of continuing information and inspiration for all seven editions. Additional
thanks go to our colleagues at UT–Austin who have provided special assistance, particularly Leonard Frank Register, Emanuel Tutuc, Ray Chen,
Ananth Dodabalapur, Seth Bank, Misha Belkin, Zheng Wang, Neal Hall,
Deji Akinwande, Jack Lee, and Dean Neikirk. Hema Movva provided useful
assistance with the typing of the homework solutions. We thank the many
companies and organizations cited in the figure captions for generously providing photographs and illustrations of devices and fabrication processes.
Bob Doering at TI, Mark Bohr at Intel, Chandra Mouli at Micron, Babu
Chalamala at MEMC and Kevin Lally at TEL deserve special mention for
the new pictures in this edition. Finally, we recall with gratitude many years
of association with Joe Campbell, Karl Hess, and the late Al Tasch, valued
colleagues and friends.

Crystal Properties and Growth
of Semiconductors
In studying solid state electronic devices we are interested primarily in the
electrical behavior of solids. However, we shall see in later chapters that the
transport of charge through a metal or a semiconductor depends not only
on the properties of the electron but also on the arrangement of atoms in
the solid. In this chapter we shall discuss some of the physical properties of
semiconductors compared with other solids, the atomic arrangements of various materials, and some methods of growing semiconductor crystals. Topics
such as crystal structure and crystal growth technology are often the subjects
of books rather than introductory chapters; thus we shall consider only a few
of the more important and fundamental ideas that form the basis for understanding electronic properties of semiconductors and device fabrication.
Semiconductors are a group of materials having electrical conductivities
intermediate between metals and insulators. It is significant that the conductivity of these materials can be varied over orders of magnitude by changes
in temperature, optical excitation, and impurity content. This variability of
electrical properties makes the semiconductor materials natural choices for
electronic device investigations.
Semiconductor materials are found in column IV and neighboring
columns of the periodic table (Table 1–1). The column IV semiconductors,
silicon and germanium, are called elemental semiconductors because they are
composed of single species of atoms. In addition to the elemental materials,
compounds of column III and column V atoms, as well as certain combinations from II and VI, and from IV, make up the compound semiconductors.

As Table 1–1 indicates, there are numerous semiconductor materials. As we shall see, the wide variety of electronic and optical properties of
these semiconductors provides the device engineer with great flexibility in
the design of electronic and optoelectronic functions. The elemental semiconductor Ge was widely used in the early days of semiconductor development for transistors and diodes. Silicon is now used for the majority of
rectifiers, transistors, and integrated circuits (ICs). However, the compounds
are widely used in high-speed devices and devices requiring the emission or
absorption of light. The two-element (binary) III–V compounds such as GaN,
GaP, and GaAs are common in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). As discussed in
Section 1.2.4, three-element (ternary) compounds such as GaAsP and fourelement (quaternary) compounds such as InGaAsP can be grown to provide
added flexibility in choosing materials properties.
Fluorescent materials such as those used in television screens usually are II–VI compound semiconductors such as ZnS. Light detectors are
commonly made with InSb, CdSe, or other compounds such as PbTe and
HgCdTe. Si and Ge are also widely used as infrared and nuclear radiation
detectors. Light-emitting diodes are made using GaN and other III–V compounds. Semiconductor lasers are made using GaAs, AlGaAs, and other ternary and quaternary compounds.
One of the most important characteristics of a semiconductor, which
distinguishes it from metals and insulators, is its energy band gap. This property,
which we will discuss in detail in Chapter 3, determines among other things the
wavelengths of light that can be absorbed or emitted by the semiconductor.
For example, the band gap of GaAs is about 1.43 electron volts (eV), which

corresponds to light wavelengths in the near infrared. In contrast, GaP has a
band gap of about 2.3 eV, corresponding to wavelengths in the green portion
of the spectrum.1The band gap Eg for various semiconductor materials is listed
along with other properties in Appendix III. As a result of the wide variety
of semiconductor band gaps, LEDs and lasers can be constructed with wavelengths over a broad range of the infrared and visible portions of the spectrum.
The electronic and optical properties of semiconductor materials are
strongly affected by impurities, which may be added in precisely controlled
amounts. Such impurities are used to vary the conductivities of semiconductors over wide ranges and even to alter the nature of the conduction
processes from conduction by negative charge carriers to positive charge
carriers. For example, an impurity concentration of one part per million can
change a sample of Si from a poor conductor to a good conductor of electric
current. This process of controlled addition of impurities, called doping, will
be discussed in detail in subsequent chapters.
To investigate these useful properties of semiconductors, it is necessary
to understand the atomic arrangements in the materials. Obviously, if slight
alterations in purity of the original material can produce such dramatic changes
in electrical properties, then the nature and specific arrangement of atoms in
each semiconductor must be of critical importance. Therefore, we begin our
study of semiconductors with a brief introduction to crystal structure.
In this section we discuss the arrangements of atoms in various solids. We
shall distinguish between single crystals and other forms of materials and
then investigate the periodicity of crystal lattices. Certain important crystallographic terms will be defined and illustrated in reference to crystals
having a basic cubic structure. These definitions will allow us to refer to
certain planes and directions within a lattice. Finally, we shall investigate the
diamond lattice; this structure, with some variations, is typical of most of the
semiconductor materials used in electronic devices.
1.2.1 Periodic Structures
A crystalline solid is distinguished by the fact that the atoms making up the
crystal are arranged in a periodic fashion. That is, there is some basic arrangement of atoms that is repeated throughout the entire solid. Thus the crystal
appears exactly the same at one point as it does at a series of other equivalent
points, once the basic periodicity is discovered. However, not all solids are
crystals (Fig. 1–1); some have no periodic structure at all (amorphous solids),
and others are composed of many small regions of single-crystal material
(polycrystalline solids). The high-resolution micrograph shown in Fig. 6–33
illustrates the periodic array of atoms in the single-crystal silicon of a transistor channel compared with the amorphous SiO2 (glass) of the oxide layer.
1.2
CryStal lattiCeS24 Chapter 1
The periodicity in a crystal is defined in terms of a symmetric array of
points in space called the lattice. We can add atoms at each lattice point in
an arrangement called a basis, which can be one atom or a group of atoms
having the same spatial arrangement, to get a crystal. In every case, the lattice
contains a volume or cell that represents the entire lattice and is regularly
repeated throughout the crystal. As an example of such a lattice, Fig. 1–2
shows a two-dimensional arrangement of atoms called a rhombic lattice,
with a primitive cell ODEF, which is the smallest such cell. Notice that we
can define vectors a and b such that if the primitive cell is translated by integral multiples of these vectors, a new primitive cell identical to the original
is found (e.g., O'D'E'F'). These vectors, a and b (and c if the lattice is three
dimensional), are called the primitive vectors for the lattice. Points within the
lattice are indistinguishable if the vector between the points is
r = pa + qb + sc (1–1)
where p, q, and s are integers. The primitive cell shown has lattice points only
at the corners of the cell. The primitive cell is not unique, but it must cover

the entire volume of the crystal (without missing or extra bits) by translations
by integer numbers of primitive vectors, and it can have only one lattice point
per cell. The convention is to choose the smallest primitive vectors. Note
that, in the primitive cell shown in Fig. 1–2, the lattice points at the corners
are shared with adjacent cells; thus, the effective number of lattice points
belonging to the primitive cell is unity. Since there are many different ways
of placing atoms in a volume, the distances and orientation between atoms
can take many forms, leading to different lattice and crystal structures. It is
important to remember that the symmetry determines the lattice, not the
magnitudes of the distances between the lattice points.
In many lattices, however, the primitive cell is not the most convenient
to work with. For example, in Fig. 1–2, we see that the rhombic arrangement
of the lattice points is such that it can also be considered to be rectangular
(PQRS) with a lattice point in the center at T (a so-called centered rectangular lattice). (Note that this is not true of all rhombic lattices!) Clearly, it
is simpler to deal with a rectangle rather than a rhombus. So, in this case we
can choose to work with a larger rectangular unit cell, PQRS, rather than the
smallest primitive cell, ODEF. A unit cell allows lattice points not only at the
corners but also at the face center (and body center in 3-D) if necessary. It is
sometimes used instead of the primitive cell if it can represent the symmetry
of the lattice better (in this example “centered rectangular” two-dimensional
lattice). It replicates the lattice by integer translations of basis vectors.
The importance of the unit cell lies in the fact that we can analyze the
crystal as a whole by investigating a representative volume. For example,
from the unit cell we can find the distances between nearest atoms and next
nearest atoms for calculation of the forces holding the lattice together; we
can look at the fraction of the unit cell volume filled by atoms and relate the
density of the solid to the atomic arrangement. But even more important for
our interest in electronic devices, the properties of the periodic crystal lattice
determine the allowed energies of electrons that participate in the conduction process. Thus the lattice determines not only the mechanical properties
of the crystal but also its electrical properties.
1.2.2 Cubic lattices
The simplest three-dimensional lattice is one in which the unit cell is a cubic
volume, such as the three cells shown in Fig. 1–3. The simple cubic structure
(abbreviated sc) has an atom located at each corner of the unit cell. The
a

lattice structures.26 Chapter 1
body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice has an additional atom at the center of the
cube, and the face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell has atoms at the eight corners
and centered on the six faces. All three structures have different primitive
cells, but the same cubic unit cell. We will generally work with unit cells.
As atoms are packed into the lattice in any of these arrangements, the
distances between neighboring atoms will be determined by a balance between
the forces that attract them together and other forces that hold them apart.We
shall discuss the nature of these forces for particular solids in Section 3.1.1. For
now, we can calculate the maximum fraction of the lattice volume that can be
filled with atoms by approximating the atoms as hard spheres. For example,
Fig. 1–4 illustrates the packing of spheres in a fcc cell of side a, such that the
nearest neighbors touch. The dimension a for a cubic unit cell is called the lattice constant. For the fcc lattice the nearest neighbor distance is one-half the
diagonal of a face, or 1 2 (a22). Therefore, for the atom centered on the face to
just touch the atoms at each corner of the face, the radius of the sphere must
be one-half the nearest neighbor distance, or 1 4(a22).

1.2.3 Planes and directions
In discussing crystals it is very helpful to be able to refer to planes and directions within the lattice. The notation system generally adopted uses a set of
three integers to describe the position of a plane or the direction of a vector
within the lattice. We first set up an xyz coordinate system with the origin at
any lattice point (it does not matter which one because they are all equivalent!), and the axes are lined up with the edges of the cubic unit cell. The
three integers describing a particular plane are found in the following way:
1. Find the intercepts of the plane with the crystal axes and express
these intercepts as integral multiples of the basis vectors (the plane
can be moved in and out from the origin, retaining its orientation,
until such an integral intercept is discovered on each axis).
2. Take the reciprocals of the three integers found in step 1 and reduce
these to the smallest set of integers h, k, and l, which have the same
relationship to each other as the three reciprocals.
3. Label the plane (hkl).
The plane illustrated in Fig. 1–5 has intercepts at 2a, 4b, and 1c along the examPle 1–2
three crystal axes. Taking the reciprocals of these intercepts, we get 1 2 ,
14
, and 1. These three fractions have the same relationship to each other
as the integers 2, 1, and 4 (obtained by multiplying each fraction by 4).
Thus the plane can be referred to as a (214) plane. The only exception is
if the intercept is a fraction of the lattice constant a. In that case, we do
not reduce it to the lowest set of integers. For example, in Fig. 1–3, planes
parallel to the cube faces, but going through the body center atoms in the
bcc lattice, would be (200) and not (100).

plane.
The three integers h, k, and l are called the Miller indices; these three
numbers define a set of parallel planes in the lattice. One advantage of taking
the reciprocals of the intercepts is avoidance of infinities in the notation. One28 Chapter 1
intercept is infinity for a plane parallel to an axis; however, the reciprocal
of such an intercept is taken as zero. If a plane contains one of the axes, it
is parallel to that axis and has a zero reciprocal intercept. If a plane passes
through the origin, it can be translated to a parallel position for calculation of
the Miller indices. If an intercept occurs on the negative branch of an axis, the
minus sign is placed above the Miller index for convenience, such as (hkl).
From a crystallographic point of view, many planes in a lattice are
equivalent; that is, a plane with given Miller indices can be shifted about
in the lattice simply by choice of the position and orientation of the unit
cell. The indices of such equivalent planes are enclosed in braces { } instead of
parentheses. For example, in the cubic lattice of Fig. 1–6, all the cube faces are
crystallographically equivalent in that the unit cell can be rotated in various
directions and still appear the same. The six equivalent faces are collectively
designated as {100}.
A direction in a lattice is expressed as a set of three integers with the
same relationship as the components of a vector in that direction. The three
vector components are expressed in multiples of the basis vectors, and the
three integers are reduced to their smallest values while retaining the relationship among them. For example, the body diagonal in the cubic lattice
(Fig. 1–7a) is composed of the components 1a, 1b, and 1c; therefore, this
diagonal is the [111] direction. (Brackets are used for direction indices.) As in
the case of planes, many directions in a lattice are equivalent, depending only
on the arbitrary choice of orientation for the axes. Such equivalent direction
indices are placed in angular brackets 8 9. For example, the crystal axes in the
cubic lattice [100], [010], and [001] are all equivalent and are called 81009
directions (Fig. 1–7b).

Two useful relationships in terms of Miller indices describe the distance
between planes and angles between directions. The distance d between two
adjacent planes labeled (hkl) is given in terms of the lattice constant, a, as
d = a>(h2 + k2 + l 2)1>2 (1–2a)
The angle u between two different Miller index directions is given by
cos u = 5h1h2 + k1k2 + l1l265(h12 + k12 + l12)1>2(h22 + k22 + l22)1>26 (1–2b)
Comparing Figs. 1–6 and 1–7, we notice that in cubic lattices a direction
[hkl] is perpendicular to the plane (hkl). This is convenient in analyzing lattices with cubic unit cells, but it should be remembered that it is not necessarily true in noncubic systems.
1.2.4 the diamond lattice
The basic crystal structure for many important semiconductors is the fcc
lattice with a basis of two atoms, giving rise to the diamond structure, characteristic of Si, Ge, and C in the diamond form. In many compound semiconductors, atoms are arranged in a basic diamond structure, but are different
on alternating sites. This is called a zinc blende structure and is typical of the
III–V compounds. One of the simplest ways of stating the construction of
the diamond structure is the following:
The diamond structure can be thought of as an fcc lattice with an
extra atom placed at a>4 + b>4 + c>4 from each of the fcc atoms.
Figure 1–8a illustrates the construction of a diamond lattice from an fcc
unit cell. We notice that when the vectors are drawn with components onefourth of the cube edge in each direction, only four additional points within
the same unit cell are reached. Vectors drawn from any of the other fcc atoms
simply determine corresponding points in adjacent unit cells. This method of

constructing the diamond lattice implies that the original fcc has associated
with it a second interpenetrating fcc displaced by 1 4, 1 4 , 1 4 . The two interpenetrating fcc sublattices can be visualized by looking down on the unit cell
of Fig. 1–8a from the top (or along any 81009 direction). In the top view of
Fig. 1–8b, atoms belonging to the original fcc are represented by open circles,
and the interpenetrating sublattice is shaded. If the atoms are all similar, we
call this structure a diamond lattice; if the atoms differ on alternating sites, it
is a zinc blende structure. For example, if one fcc sublattice is composed of
Ga atoms and the interpenetrating sublattice is As, the zinc blende structure
of GaAs results. Most of the compound semiconductors have this type of
lattice, although some of the II–VI compounds are arranged in a slightly
different structure called the wurtzite lattice. We shall restrict our discussion
here to the diamond and zinc blende structures, since they are typical of most
of the commonly used semiconductors.

SolutionCrystal Properties and Growth of Semiconductors 31
A particularly interesting and useful feature of the III–V compounds
is the ability to vary the mixture of elements on each of the two interpenetrating fcc sublattices of the zinc blende crystal. For example, in the ternary
compound AlGaAs, it is possible to vary the composition of the ternary alloy
by choosing the fraction of Al or Ga atoms on the column III sublattice. It
is common to represent the composition by assigning subscripts to the various elements. For example, AlxGa1–xAs refers to a ternary alloy in which the
column III sublattice in the zinc blende structure contains a fraction x of Al
atoms and 1–x of Ga atoms. The composition Al0.3Ga0.7As has 30 percent Al
and 70 percent Ga on the column III sites, with the interpenetrating column V
sublattice occupied entirely by As atoms. It is extremely useful to be able
to grow ternary alloy crystals such as this with a given composition. For the
Al
xGa1–xAs example we can grow crystals over the entire composition range
from x = 0 to x = 1, thus varying the electronic and optical properties of
the material from that of GaAs (x = 0) to that of AlAs (x = 1). To vary
the properties even further, it is possible to grow four-element (quaternary)
compounds such as InxGa1–xAsyP1–y having a very wide range of properties.
It is important from an electronic point of view to notice that each
atom in the diamond and zinc blende structures is surrounded by four nearest neighbors (Fig. 1–9). The importance of this relationship of each atom
to its neighbors will become evident in Section 3.1.1 when we discuss the
bonding forces which hold the lattice together.
The fact that atoms in a crystal are arranged in certain planes is important to many of the mechanical, metallurgical, and chemical properties of
the material. For example, crystals often can be cleaved along certain atomic
planes, resulting in exceptionally planar surfaces. This is a familiar result in
cleaved diamonds for jewelry; the facets of a diamond reveal clearly the
triangular, hexagonal, and rectangular symmetries of intersecting planes in
various crystallographic directions. Semiconductors with diamond and zinc
blende lattices have similar cleavage planes. Chemical reactions, such as
etching of the crystal, often take place preferentially along certain directions. These properties serve as interesting illustrations of crystal symmetry,
but in addition, each plays an important role in fabrication processes for
many semiconductor devices.

The progress of solid state device technology since the invention of the transistor in 1948 has depended not only on the development of device concepts
but also on the improvement of materials. For example, the fact that ICs can
be made today is the result of a considerable breakthrough in the growth
of pure, single-crystal Si in the early and mid-1950s. The requirements on
the growing of device-grade semiconductor crystals are more stringent than
those for any other materials. Not only must semiconductors be available in
large single crystals, but also the purity must be controlled within extremely
close limits. For example, Si crystals now being used in devices are grown with
concentrations of most impurities of less than one part in ten billion. Such
purities require careful handling and treatment of the material at each step
of the manufacturing process.
1.3.1 Starting materials
The raw feedstock for Si crystal is silicon dioxide (SiO2). We react SiO2 with
C in the form of coke in an arc furnace at very high temperatures (~1800°C)
to reduce SiO2 according to the following reaction:
SiO2 + 2C S Si + 2CO (1–3)
This forms metallurgical grade Si (MGS) which has impurities such
as Fe, Al, and heavy metals at levels of several hundred to several thousand
parts per million (ppm). Refer back to Example 1–3 to see that 1 ppm of
Si corresponds to an impurity level of 5 * 1016 cm - 3. While MGS is clean
enough for metallurgical applications such as using Si to make stainless
steel, it is not pure enough for electronic applications; it is also not single
crystal.
1.3
bulk CryStal
GrowthCrystal Properties and Growth of Semiconductors 33
The MGS is refined further to yield semiconductor-grade or electronicgrade Si (EGS), in which the levels of impurities are reduced to parts per
billion or ppb (1 ppb = 5 * 1013 cm - 3). This involves reacting the MGS with
dry HCl according to the following reaction to form trichlorosilane, SiHCl3,
which is a liquid with a boiling point of 32°C:
Si + 3HCl S SiHCl3 + H2 (1–4)
Along with SiHCl3, chlorides of impurities such as FeCl3 are formed
which fortunately have boiling points that are different from that of SiHCl3.
This allows a technique called fractional distillation to be used, in which we
heat up the mixture of SiHCl3 and the impurity chlorides, and condense the
vapors in different distillation towers held at appropriate temperatures. We
can thereby separate pure SiHCl3 from the impurities. SiHCl3 is then converted to highly pure EGS by reaction with H2,
2SiHCl3 + 2H 2 S 2Si + 6HCl (1–5)
1.3.2 Growth of Single-Crystal ingots
Next, we have to convert the high purity but still polycrystalline EGS to
single-crystal Si ingots or boules. This is generally done today by a process
commonly called the Czochralski method. In order to grow single-crystal
material, it is necessary to have a seed crystal which can provide a template
for growth. We melt the EGS in a quartz-lined graphite crucible by resistively
heating it to the melting point of Si (1412°C).
A seed crystal is lowered into the molten material and then is raised
slowly, allowing the crystal to grow onto the seed (Fig. 1–10a). Generally, the

crystal is rotated slowly as it grows to provide a slight stirring of the melt and
to average out any temperature variations that would cause inhomogeneous
solidification. This technique is widely used in growing Si, Ge, and some of
the compound semiconductors.
In pulling compounds such as GaAs from the melt, it is necessary to
prevent volatile elements (e.g., As) from vaporizing. In one method a layer
of B2O3, which is dense and viscous when molten, floats on the surface of
the molten GaAs to prevent As evaporation. This growth method is called
liquid-encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) growth.
In Czochralski crystal growth, the shape of the ingot is determined by
a combination of the tendency of the cross section to assume a polygonal
shape due to the crystal structure and the influence of surface tension, which
encourages a circular cross section. The crystal facets are noticeable in the
initial growth near the seed crystal in Fig. 1–10b. However, the cross section
of the large ingot in Fig. 1–11 is almost circular.
In the fabrication of Si ICs (Chapter 9) it is economical to use very large
Si wafers, so that many IC chips can be made simultaneously. As a result,
considerable research and development have gone into methods for growing
very large Si crystals. For example, Fig. 1–11 illustrates a ~12-inch or 300-mm
diameter Si ingot, 1.0 m long and weighing 140 kg, and a 300 mm wafer.
1.3.3 wafers
After the single-crystal ingot is grown, it is then mechanically processed to
manufacture wafers. The first step involves mechanically grinding the moreor-less cylindrical ingot into a perfect cylinder with a precisely controlled
diameter. This is important because in a modern IC fabrication facility, many
processing tools and wafer handling robots require tight tolerances on the
size of the wafers. Using X-ray crystallography, crystal planes in the ingot are
identified. For reasons discussed in Section 6.4.3, most Si ingots are grown
along the 81009 direction (Fig. 1–10). For such ingots, a small notch is ground
on one side of the cylinder to delineate a {110} face of the crystal. This is useful because for 81009 Si wafers, the {110} cleavage planes are orthogonal to
each other. This notch then allows the individual IC chips to be made oriented
along {110} planes so that when the chips are sawed apart, there is less chance
of spurious cleavage of the crystal, which could cause good chips to be lost.
Next, the Si cylinder is sawed into individual wafers about 775 µm thick,
by using a diamond-tipped inner-hole blade saw, or a wire saw (Fig. 1–12).
State-of-the-art wafers today are 300 mm in diameter; the next size will be
450 mm. The resulting wafers are mechanically lapped and ground on both
sides to achieve a flat surface, and to remove the mechanical damage due
to sawing. Such damage would have a detrimental effect on devices. The
flatness of the wafer is critical from the point of view of “depth of focus”
or how sharp an image can be focussed on the wafer surface during photolithography, as discussed in Chapter 5. The Si wafers are then rounded
or “chamfered” along the edges to minimize the likelihood of chipping the
wafers during processing. Finally, the wafers undergo chemical–mechanical36 Chapter 1

polishing using a slurry of very fine SiO2 particles in a basic NaOH solution
to give the front surface of the wafer a mirror-like finish. The wafers are
now ready for IC fabrication (Fig. 1–12). The economic value added in this
process is impressive. From sand (SiO2) costing pennies, we can obtain Si
wafers costing a few hundred dollars, on which we can make hundreds of
microprocessors, for example, each costing several hundred dollars.
1.3.4 doping
As previously mentioned, there are some impurities in the molten EGS. We
may also add intentional impurities or dopants to the Si melt to change
its electronic properties. At the solidifying interface between the melt and
the solid, there will be a certain distribution of impurities between the two
phases. An important quantity that identifies this property is the distribution
coefficient kd, which is the ratio of the concentration of the impurity in the
solid CS to the concentration in the liquid CL at equilibrium:
kd =
CS
CL (1–6)Crystal Properties and Growth of Semiconductors 37
The distribution coefficient is a function of the material, the impurity,
the temperature of the solid–liquid interface, and the growth rate. For an
impurity with a distribution coefficient of one-half, the relative concentration of the impurity in the molten liquid to that in the refreezing solid is two
to one. Thus the concentration of impurities in that portion of material that
solidifies first is one-half the original concentration C0. The distribution coefficient is thus important during growth from a melt. This can be illustrated
by an example involving Czochralski growth:

Solution
One of the most important and versatile methods of crystal growth for device
applications is the growth of a thin crystal layer on a wafer of a compatible
crystal. The substrate crystal may be a wafer of the same material as the
grown layer or a different material with a similar lattice structure. In this
process the substrate serves as the seed crystal onto which the new crystalline
material grows. The growing crystal layer maintains the crystal structure and
orientation of the substrate. The technique of growing an oriented singlecrystal layer on a substrate wafer is called epitaxial growth, or epitaxy. As we
shall see in this section, epitaxial growth can be performed at temperatures
considerably below the melting point of the substrate crystal. A variety of
methods are used to provide the appropriate atoms to the surface of the
growing layer. These methods include chemical vapor deposition (CVD),2

or amorphous. When a CVD process results in a single-crystal epitaxial layer, a more specific term is
vapor-phase epitaxy (VPE).38 Chapter 1
growth from a melt (liquid-phase epitaxy, LPE), and evaporation of the elements in a vacuum (molecular beam epitaxy, MBE). With this wide range
of epitaxial growth techniques, it is possible to grow a variety of crystals for
device applications, having properties specifically designed for the electronic
or optoelectronic device being made.
1.4.1 lattice-matching in epitaxial Growth
When Si epitaxial layers are grown on Si substrates, there is a natural matching of the crystal lattice, and high-quality single-crystal layers result. On the
other hand, it is often desirable to obtain epitaxial layers that differ somewhat from the substrate, which is known as heteroepitaxy. This can be accomplished easily if the lattice structure and lattice constant a match for the two
materials. For example, GaAs and AlAs both have the zinc blende structure,
with a lattice constant of about 5.65 Å. As a result, epitaxial layers of the ternary alloy AlGaAs can be grown on GaAs substrates with little lattice mismatch. Similarly, GaAs can be grown on Ge substrates (see Appendix III).
Since AlAs and GaAs have similar lattice constants, it is also true that
the ternary alloy AlGaAs has essentially the same lattice constant over the
entire range of compositions from AlAs to GaAs. As a result, one can choose
the composition x of the ternary compound AlxGa1–xAs to fit the particular
device requirement, and grow this composition on a GaAs wafer. The resulting epitaxial layer will be lattice-matched to the GaAs substrate.
Figure 1–13 illustrates the energy band gap Eg as a function of lattice
constant a for several III–V ternary compounds as they are varied over their
composition ranges. For example, as the ternary compound InGaAs is varied
by choice of composition on the column III sublattice from InAs to GaAs,
the band gap changes from 0.36 to 1.43 eV while the lattice constant of the
crystal varies from 6.06 Å for InAs to 5.65 Å for GaAs. Clearly, we cannot
grow this ternary compound over the entire composition range on a particular
binary substrate, which has a fixed lattice constant. As Fig. 1–13 illustrates,
however, it is possible to grow a specific composition of InGaAs on an InP
substrate. The vertical (invariant lattice constant) line from InP to the InGaAs
curve shows that a midrange ternary composition (actually, In0.53Ga0.47As) can
be grown lattice-matched to an InP substrate. Similarly, a ternary InGaP alloy
with about 50 percent Ga and 50 percent In on the column III sublattice can
be grown lattice-matched to a GaAs substrate. To achieve a broader range
of alloy compositions, grown lattice-matched on particular substrates, it is
helpful to use quaternary alloys such as InGaAsP. The variation of compositions on both the column III and column V sublattices provides additional
flexibility in choosing a particular band gap while providing lattice-matching
to convenient binary substrates such as GaAs or InP.
In the case of GaAsP, the lattice constant is intermediate between that
of GaAs and GaP, depending upon the composition. For example, GaAsP
crystals used in red LEDs have 40 percent phosphorus and 60 percent arsenic
on the column V sublattice. Since such a crystal cannot be grown directly onCrystal Properties and Growth of Semiconductors 39

Relationship between band gap and lattice constant for alloys in the InGaAsP and AlGaAsSb
systems. The dashed vertical lines show the lattice constants for the commercially available binary
substrates GaAs and InP. For the marked example of InxGa1–xAs, the ternary composition x = 0.53
can be grown lattice-matched on InP, since the lattice constants are the same. For quaternary alloys,
the compositions on both the III and V sublattices can be varied to grow lattice-matched epitaxial layers
along the dashed vertical lines between curves. For example, InxGa1–xAsyP1–y can be grown on InP
substrates, with resulting band gaps ranging from 0.75 eV to 1.35 eV. In using this figure, assume the
lattice constant a of a ternary alloy varies linearly with the composition x.
either a GaAs or a GaP substrate, it is necessary to gradually change the lattice constant as the crystal is grown. Using a GaAs or Ge wafer as a substrate,
the growth is begun at a composition near GaAs. A region ∼25 om thick is
grown while gradually introducing phosphorus until the desired As/P ratio
is achieved. The desired epitaxial layer (e.g., 100 om thick) is then grown on
this graded layer. By this method epitaxial growth always occurs on a crystal
of similar lattice constant. Although some crystal dislocations occur due to
lattice strain in the graded region, such crystals are of high quality and can
be used in LEDs.40 Chapter 1
In addition to the widespread use of lattice-matched epitaxial layers,
the advanced epitaxial growth techniques described in the following sections
allow the growth of very thin (~100 Å) layers of lattice-mismatched crystals. If the mismatch is only a few percent and the layer is thin, the epitaxial
layer grows with a lattice constant in compliance with that of the seed crystal
(Fig. 1–14). The resulting layer is in compression or tension along the surface
plane as its lattice constant adapts to the seed crystal (Fig. 1–14). Such a layer
is called pseudomorphic because it is not lattice-matched to the substrate
without strain. However, if the epitaxial layer exceeds a critical layer thickness, tc, which depends on the lattice mismatch, the strain energy leads to formation of defects called misfit dislocations. Using thin alternating layers of
slightly mismatched crystal layers, it is possible to grow a strained-layer superlattice (SLS) in which alternate layers are in tension and compression. The
overall SLS lattice constant is an average of that of the two bulk materials.
1.4.2 vapor-Phase epitaxy
The advantages of low temperature and high-purity epitaxial growth can be
achieved by crystallization from the vapor phase. Crystalline layers can be grown
onto a seed or substrate from a chemical vapor of the semiconductor material

mismatch between SiGe and Si leads to compressive strain in the SiGe layer. The amount of strain
depends on the mole fraction of Ge. (a) For layer thicknesses less than the critical layer thickness, tc,
pseudomorphic growth occurs. (b) However, above tc, misfit dislocations form at the interface which may
reduce the usefulness of the layers in device applications.Crystal Properties and Growth of Semiconductors 41
or from mixtures of chemical vapors containing the semiconductor.Vapor-phase
epitaxy (VPE) is a particularly important source of semiconductor material for
use in devices. Some compounds such as GaAs can be grown with better purity
and crystal perfection by vapor epitaxy than by other methods. Furthermore,
these techniques offer great flexibility in the actual fabrication of devices. When
an epitaxial layer is grown on a substrate, it is relatively simple to obtain a sharp
demarcation between the type of impurity doping in the substrate and in the
grown layer. The advantages of this freedom to vary the impurity will be discussed in subsequent chapters. We point out here, however, that Si IC devices
(Chapter 9) are usually built in layers grown by VPE on Si wafers.
Epitaxial layers are generally grown on Si substrates by the controlled
deposition of Si atoms onto the surface from a chemical vapor containing
Si. In one method, a gas of silicon tetrachloride reacts with hydrogen gas to
give Si and anhydrous HCl:
SiCl4 + 2H2 L Si + 4HCl (1–7)
If this reaction occurs at the surface of a heated crystal, the Si atoms
released in the reaction can be deposited as an epitaxial layer. The HCl remains
gaseous at the reaction temperature and does not disturb the growing crystal. As
indicated, this reaction is reversible. This is very important because it implies
that by adjusting the process parameters, the reaction in Eq. (1–7) can be driven
to the left (providing etching of the Si rather than deposition). This etching can
be used for preparing an atomically clean surface on which epitaxy can occur.
This vapor epitaxy technique requires a chamber into which the gases
can be introduced and a method for heating the Si wafers. Since the chemical
reactions take place in this chamber, it is called a reaction chamber or, more
simply, a reactor. Hydrogen gas is passed through a heated vessel in which
SiCl4 is evaporated; then the two gases are introduced into the reactor over the
substrate crystal, along with other gases containing the desired doping impurities. The Si slice is placed on a graphite susceptor or some other material that
can be heated to the reaction temperature with an rf heating coil or tungsten
halogen lamps. This method can be adapted to grow epitaxial layers of closely
controlled impurity concentration on many Si slices simultaneously (Fig. 1–15).

The reaction temperature for the hydrogen reduction of SiCl4 is
approximately 1150–1250°C. Other reactions may be employed at somewhat
lower temperatures, including the use of dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2) at 1000–
1100°C, or the pyrolysis of silane (SiH4) at 500–1000°C. Pyrolysis involves
the breaking up of the silane at the reaction temperature:
SiH4 S Si + 2H2 (1–8)
There are several advantages of the lower reaction temperature processes, including the fact that they reduce migration of impurities from the
substrate to the growing epitaxial layer.
In some applications it is useful to grow thin Si layers on insulating
substrates. For example, vapor-phase epitaxial techniques can be used to
grow ~1 µm Si films on sapphire and other insulators.
Vapor-phase epitaxial growth is also important in the III–V compounds, such as GaAs, GaP, and the ternary alloy GaAsP, which is widely
used in the fabrication of LEDs. Substrates are held at about 800°C on a
rotating wafer holder while phosphine, arsine, and gallium chloride gases
are mixed and passed over the samples. The GaCl is obtained by reacting
anhydrous HCl with molten Ga within the reactor. Variation of the crystal
composition for GaAsP can be controlled by altering the mixture of arsine
and phosphine gases.
Another useful method for epitaxial growth of compound semiconductors is called metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE), or organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy (OMVPE). For example, the organometallic
compound trimethylgallium can be reacted with arsine to form GaAs and
methane:
(CH3)3Ga + AsH3 S GaAs + 3CH4 (1–9)
This reaction takes place at about 700°C, and epitaxial growth of
high-quality GaAs layers can be obtained. Other compound semiconductors can also be grown by this method. For example, trimethylaluminum
can be added to the gas mixture to grow AlGaAs. This growth method is
widely used in the fabrication of a variety of devices, including solar cells
and lasers. The convenient variability of the gas mixture allows the growth
of multiple thin layers similar to those discussed below for molecular beam
epitaxy.
1.4.3 molecular beam epitaxy
One of the most versatile techniques for growing epitaxial layers is called
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In this method the substrate is held in a
high vacuum while molecular or atomic beams of the constituents impinge
upon its surface (Fig. 1–16a). For example, in the growth of AlGaAs layers
on GaAs substrates, the Al, Ga, and As components, along with dopants, are
heated in separate cylindrical cells. Collimated beams of these constituents
escape into the vacuum and are directed onto the surface of the substrate.Crystal Properties and Growth of Semiconductors 43

Each layer is four monolayers (4 * a/2 = 11.3 A° ;) thick.44 Chapter 1

of Texas at Austin.
The rates at which these atomic beams strike the surface can be closely controlled, and growth of very high-quality crystals results. The sample is held
at a relatively low temperature (about 600°C for GaAs) in this growth procedure. Abrupt changes in doping or in crystal composition (e.g., changing
from GaAs to AlGaAs) can be obtained by controlling shutters in front of
the individual beams. Using slow growth rates (…1 om/h), it is possible to
control the shutters to make composition changes on the scale of the lattice
constant. For example, Fig. 1–16b illustrates a portion of a crystal grown
with alternating layers of GaAs and AlGaAs only four monolayers thick.
Because of the high vacuum and close controls involved, MBE requires a
rather sophisticated setup (Fig. 1–17). However, the versatility of this growth
method makes it very attractive for many applications.
As MBE has developed in recent years, it has become common to
replace some of the solid sources shown in Fig. 1–16 with gaseous chemical
sources. This approach, called chemical beam epitaxy, or gas-source MBE,
combines many of the advantages of MBE and VPE.
In the next two chapters, we will discuss the propagation of various types of
waves in finite size crystals. It is instructive to look at some of the general attributes of such waves in a medium made of discrete, periodic atoms. Recall that
a wave is characterized by various parameters such as wavelength, l, angular
frequency, v = 2py, phase, y, and intensity, I = A2, where A is the amplitude
of the wave [Fig.1–18a]. The speed of the wave, vp = ly. Instead of wavelength,
one can also describe a wave in terms of the wavevector, k = 2p/l. The velocity vp, which is called the phase velocity of the wave, then can also be written as
v/k. In general, one may deal with not a single wave train, but a wave packet,
1.5
wave

StruCtureSCrystal Properties and Growth of Semiconductors 45
made up of a superposition of various waves [Fig. 1–18b]. The wave packet
can be shown to travel with a group velocity, vg = dv/dk. A plane wave, e,
propagating in the {x direction can be written as e = A exp 5j(kx { vt)6,
where j is the imaginary number. Equivalently, one can take linear combinations of these plane waves and describe them as standing waves
sin(kx { vt) and/or cos(kx { vt).
There are a few quirks when one looks at plane waves propagating in a
finite crystal with lattice constant a and of length L = Na, where N is the number of atoms [Fig. 1–18a]. Plane traveling waves cannot propagate in a finite
crystal—reflections at the boundaries will give rise to standing wave patterns. It
turns out that the mathematics is simpler in terms of plane waves propagating
in an infinite crystal. As long as we are interested in the bulk, rather than the
surface, properties of the crystal, one can artificially create an infinite crystal
by repeating the finite crystal of length L over all space, and requiring that the
value of the wave is equal on the two faces of the finite crystal, e(0) = e(L).
This is known as the periodic boundary condition [Fig. 1–18b].
The second quirk about these waves is that in a discrete medium such
as a crystal, where atoms are located at a spacing a, the wavelengths are
physically distinguishable only up to a point. This is clear from Fig. 1–18a,
where one sees that two waves representing the displacement of the atoms
are physically indistinguishable. This means that the wavelengths below 2a,
or wave vectors, k, greater than 2r/2a = p/a are meaningless. The maximum range of k is known as the Brillouin zone. Notice that this would
not be true in a continuous medium, that is, where the lattice constant a
approaches zero.

(a) The displacement pattern of the atoms shown in black in a one-dimensional crystal can be
described equivalently by a longer or shorter wavelength. The shortest possible wavelength
(i.e., largest k vector) determines the Brillouin zone. In a finite crystal, we have a standing wave
pattern. (b) A more complicated wave involving a mixing of two wavelengths (or Fourier components
in k-space) giving rise to a beat pattern. By using a periodic boundary condition for the finite crystal
in (a), one ends up with propagating waves rather than standing waves, making the math simpler.46 Chapter 1
Problems of wave propagation in periodic structures can be described
in so-called real space, x, or alternatively in reciprocal k-space. An analogy
would be describing a periodic signal f(t) = f(t + T), either in the time
domain or by taking the Fourier transform, in the frequency domain, F(v).
Here, the time period T is equivalent to the length of the crystal, L. One can
extend this analogy further by considering not continuous signals f(t), but
sampled time-domain signals as in digital signal processing. If the sampling
rate is Δt, one must use a Discrete Fourier Transform, where the highest relevant frequency is the Nyquist frequency. The sampling rate Δt corresponds
to the lattice constant, a, and the Nyquist frequency corresponds to the edge
of the Brillouin zone.
Incidentally, in Chapter 3 we will see that such waves describing physical displacement of atoms correspond to sound waves propagating in the
crystal, and are called phonons. In Chapters 2 and 3, we will see that electrons
propagating in crystals can also be described by a wave using the language
of quantum mechanics, in term of a complex “wavefunction.” However, such
electron wavefunctions are described by the plane waves mentioned above
multiplied by another function U(kx, x) = U(kx, x+a) having the same periodicity as the lattice. Such wavefunctions are known as Bloch functions.
1.1 Semiconductor devices are at the heart of information technology. Elemental
semiconductors such as Si appear in column IV of the periodic table, while
compound semiconductors such as GaAs consist of elements symmetrically
around column IV. More complicated alloy semiconductors are used to optimize optoelectronic properties.
1.2 These devices are generally made in single-crystal material for best performance. Single crystals have long-range order, while polycrystalline and amorphous materials have short-range and no order, respectively.
1.3 Lattices are determined by symmetry. In 3-D, these are called Bravais lattices. When we put a basis of atom(s) on the lattice sites, we get a crystal.Common
semiconductors have an fcc symmetry with a basis of two identical or different
atoms, resulting in diamond or zinc blende crystals, respectively.
1.4 The fundamental building block of a lattice is a primitive cell with lattice points at
its corners. Sometimes it is easier to describe the crystal in terms of a larger “unit”
cell with lattice points not only at the corners but also at body or face centers.
1.5 Translating unit cells by integer numbers of basis vectors can replicate the lattice. Planes and directions in a lattice can be defined in terms of Miller indices.
1.6 Real crystals can have defects in 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-D, some of which are benign,
but many of which are harmful for device operation.
1.7 Semiconductor bulk crystals are grown from a melt by the Czochralski method,
starting from a seed. Single-crystal epitaxial layers can be grown on top of
semiconductor wafers in various ways, such as VPE, metal-organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD), or MBE. One can thereby optimize doping and
band-structure properties for device fabrication.

Chapter 2
Atoms and Electrons
Since this book is primarily an introduction to solid state devices, it would
be preferable not to delay this discussion with subjects such as atomic theory, quantum mechanics, and electron models. However, the behavior of
solid state devices is directly related to these subjects. For example, it would
be difficult to understand how an electron is transported through a semiconductor device without some knowledge of the electron and its interaction with the crystal lattice. Therefore, in this chapter we shall investigate
some of the important properties of electrons, with special emphasis on
two points: (1) the electronic structure of atoms, and (2) the interaction of
atoms and electrons with excitation, such as the absorption and emission
of light. By studying electron energies in an atom, we lay the foundation
for understanding the influence of the lattice on electrons participating in
current flow through a solid. Our discussions concerning the interaction
of light with electrons form the basis for later descriptions of changes in
the conductivity of a semiconductor with optical excitation, properties of
light-sensitive devices, and lasers.
First, we shall investigate some of the experimental observations which
led to the modern concept of the atom, and then we shall give a brief introduction to the theory of quantum mechanics. Several important concepts
will emerge from this introduction: the electrons in atoms are restricted to
certain energy levels by quantum rules; the electronic structure of atoms is
determined from these quantum conditions; and this “quantization” defines
certain allowable transitions involving absorption and emission of energy
by the electrons.

The main effort of science is to describe what happens in nature, in as complete and concise a form as possible. In physics this effort involves observing
natural phenomena, relating these observations to previously established
theory, and finally establishing a physical model for the observations. For
example, we can explain the behavior of a spring-supported weight moving up and down periodically after an initial displacement, because the differential equations describing such a simple harmonic motion have been
established by Newtonian classical mechanics.
When a new physical phenomenon is observed, it is necessary to find
out how it fits into the established models and “laws” of physics. In the vast
majority of cases this involves a direct extension of the mathematics of
well-established models to the particular conditions of the new problem. In
fact, it is not uncommon for a scientist or engineer to predict that a new
phenomenon should occur before it is actually observed, simply by a careful
study and extension of existing models and laws. The beauty of science is that
natural phenomena are not isolated events but are related to other events
by a few analytically describable laws. However, it does happen occasionally
that a set of observations cannot be described in terms of existing theories. In
such cases it is necessary to develop models which are based as far as possible
on existing laws, but which contain new aspects arising from the new phenomena. Postulating new physical principles is a serious business, and it is
done only when there is no possibility of explaining the observations with
established theory. When new assumptions and models are made, their justification lies in the following question: “Does the model describe precisely
the observations, and can reliable predictions be made based on the model?”
The model is good or poor depending on the answer to this question.
In the 1920s it became necessary to develop a new theory to describe
phenomena on the atomic scale. A long series of careful observations had
been made that clearly indicated that many events involving electrons and
atoms did not obey the classical laws of mechanics. It was necessary, therefore, to develop a new kind of mechanics to describe the behavior of particles
on this small scale. This new approach, called quantum mechanics, describes
atomic phenomena very well and also properly predicts the way in which
electrons behave in solids—our primary interest here. Through the years,
quantum mechanics has been so successful that now it stands beside the
classical laws as a valid description of nature.
A special problem arises when students first encounter the theory of
quantum mechanics. The problem is that quantum concepts are largely mathematical in nature and do not involve the “common sense” quality associated
with classical mechanics. At first, many students find quantum concepts difficult, not so much because of the mathematics involved, but because they
feel the concepts are somehow divorced from “reality.” This is a reasonable
reaction, since ideas which we consider to be real or intuitively satisfying are
usually based on our own observation. Thus the classical laws of motion are
easy to understand because we observe bodies in motion every day. On the
other hand, we observe the effects of atoms and electrons only indirectly,
2.1
intrOductiOn
tO PhysicAl
MOdEls54 Chapter 2
and naturally we have very little feeling for what is happening on the atomic
scale. It is necessary, therefore, to depend on the facility of the theory to
predict experimental results rather than to attempt to force classical analogs
onto the nonclassical phenomena of atoms and electrons.
Our approach in this chapter will be to investigate the important experimental observations that led to the quantum theory, and then to indicate how
the theory accounts for these observations. Discussions of quantum theory must
necessarily be largely qualitative in such a brief presentation, and those topics
that are most important to solid state theory will be emphasized here. Several
good references for further individual study are given at the end of this chapter.
The experiments that led to the development of quantum theory were concerned with the interaction of light and matter. On the one hand, there were
phenomena such as interference or diffraction which clearly indicated that
light has a wave character as proposed by Huygens, in contrast to the particle
or corpuscular view of light proposed by Newton. But on the other hand,
many experiments at the turn of the 20th century clearly showed that a new
theory of light was needed.
2.2.1 the Photoelectric Effect
An important observation by Planck indicated that radiation from a heated
sample, known as blackbody radiation, is emitted in discrete units of energy
called quanta; the energy units were described by hn, where n is the frequency of the radiation, and h is a quantity now called Planck’s constant
(h = 6.63 * 10 - 34 J@s). Soon after Planck developed this hypothesis, Einstein
interpreted an important experiment that clearly demonstrated the discrete
nature (quantization) of light. This experiment involved absorption of optical
energy by the electrons in a metal and the relationship between the amount of
energy absorbed and the frequency of the light (Fig. 2–1). Let us suppose that
monochromatic light is incident on the surface of a metal plate in a vacuum.
The electrons in the metal absorb energy from the light, and some of the
electrons receive enough energy to be ejected from the metal surface into

the vacuum. This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect. If the energy
of the escaping electrons is measured, a plot can be made of the maximum
energy as a function of the frequency n of the incident light (Fig. 2–1b).
One simple way of finding the maximum energy of the ejected electrons is to place another plate above the one shown in Fig. 2–1a and then create an electric field between the two plates. The potential necessary to retard
all electron flow between the plates gives the energy Em. For a particular
frequency of light incident on the sample, a maximum energy Em is observed
for the emitted electrons. The resulting plot of Em vs. n is linear, with a slope
equal to Planck’s constant. The equation of the line shown in Fig. 2–1b is
E
m = hn - qΦ (2–1)
where q is the magnitude of the electronic charge. The quantity Φ (volts) is a
characteristic of the particular metal used. When Φ is multiplied by the electronic charge, an energy (joules) is obtained which represents the minimum
energy required for an electron to escape from the metal into a vacuum. The
energy qΦ is called the work function of the metal. These results indicate
that the electrons receive an energy hn from the light and lose an amount of
energy qΦ in escaping from the surface of the metal.
This experiment demonstrates clearly that Planck’s hypothesis was
correct—light energy is contained in discrete units rather than in a continuous distribution of energies. Other experiments also indicate that, in addition to the wave nature of light, the quantized units of light energy can be
considered as localized packets of energy, called photons. (Interestingly, this
is reminiscent of the Newtonian picture.) We get the Planck relationship
E = hn = (h>2p)(2pn) = Uv (2–2a)
The photoelectron energy was found not to increase with increasing light intensity; instead the number of photoelectrons increases. This is
in sharp contrast to what classical physics would have predicted. A higher
amplitude or intensity wave packs more energy, and should have increased
the photoelectron energy. Instead, we find in quantum physics that a higher
intensity light corresponds to a larger number of these photons, and hence
a larger number of photoelectrons. Some experiments emphasize the wave
nature of light, while other experiments reveal the discrete nature of photons. This wave–particle duality is fundamental to quantum processes and
does not imply an ambiguity in the theory.
This duality is seen beautifully in the Young’s double slit diffraction
experiment. We may recall that if monochromatic light is shone through two
narrow slits onto a screen, we see diffraction and interference patterns on the
screen corresponding to high intensity bright regions (constructive interference) and low intensity dark regions (destructive interference). This is consistent with the wave picture. Now, if the intensity of the light source is reduced,
so that just a few photons are emitted per second, we find that we do not get
an interference pattern. Instead, we get specks of light wherever the photon
hits the screen, because a photon cannot be split. There is a certain amount
of randomness in terms of where the photon hits. However, if we continue56 Chapter 2
with the experiment, these random hits of the photons gradually build up the
interference pattern, corresponding to the wave picture. Statistically, there
are more photon hits in the bright regions of the screen, and fewer hits in the
dark spots. Similar results were subsequently observed with electrons and
other subatomic particles. This wave–particle duality is fundamental to the
development of quantum mechanics.
Hence, based on the wave–particle duality of light, Louis de Broglie
proposed that particles of matter (such as electrons) similarly could manifest
a wave character in certain experiments. This observation was confirmed
by the diffraction of electrons by the periodic array of atoms in a crystal
observed by Davisson and Germer. De Broglie proposed that a particle of
momentum p = mv has a wavelength given by
l = h>p = h>mv
1 p = h>l = (h/2p)(2p>l) = Uk (2–2b)
The Planck and de Broglie relationships are fundamental in quantum
physics and are valid for all situations and objects, including photons and
electrons. They connect the wave description of phenomena (frequency and
wavelength) to a particle description (energy and momentum).
The relation between frequency and wavelength (or equivalently, energy
and momentum), known as the dispersion relationship, however, is not
the same for different objects. For example, for photons, the wavelength (l)
is related to frequency by n = c/l 1 E = Uv = U(2pn) = U2p(c>l) =
Uck = cp, where c is the speed of light. For electrons, it is an approximately
parabolic dispersion relationship, E(k), also known as the band structure, as
discussed in Chapter 3.
2.2.2 Atomic spectra
One of the most valuable experiments of modern physics is the analysis of
absorption and emission of light by atoms. The de Broglie wave property of
electrons is key to understanding these experiments. For example, an electric
discharge can be created in a gas, so that the atoms begin to emit light with
wavelengths characteristic of the gas. We see this effect in a neon sign, which
is typically a glass tube filled with neon or a gas mixture, with electrodes for
creating a discharge. If the intensity of the emitted light is measured as a function of wavelength, one finds a series of sharp lines rather than a continuous
distribution of wavelengths. By the early 1900s the characteristic spectra for
several atoms were well known. A portion of the measured emission spectrum
for hydrogen is shown in Fig. 2–2, in which the vertical lines represent the
positions of observed emission peaks on the wavelength scale. Photon energy
hn is then related to wavelength by the dispersion relation l = c/n.
The lines in Fig. 2–2 appear in several groups labeled the Lyman,
Balmer, and Paschen series after their early investigators. Once the hydrogen
spectrum was established, scientists noticed several interesting relationships
among the lines. The various series in the spectrum were observed to follow
certain empirical forms:Atoms and Electrons 57
Lyman : n = cR a112 - n12 b, n = 2, 3, 4, c (2–3a)
Balmer : n = cR a212 - n12 b, n = 3, 4, 5, c (2–3b)
Paschen : n = cR a312 - n12 b, n = 4, 5, 6, c (2–3c)
where R is a constant called the Rydberg constant (R = 109,678 cm-1). If the
photon energies hn are plotted for successive values of the integer n, we notice
that each energy can be obtained by taking sums and differences of other photon energies in the spectrum (Fig. 2–3). For example, E42 in the Balmer series
is the difference between E41 and E21 in the Lyman series. This relationship
among the various series is called the Ritz combination principle. Naturally,
these empirical observations stirred a great deal of interest in constructing a
comprehensive theory for the origin of the photons given off by atoms.

thE bOhr MOdEl
The results of emission spectra experiments led Niels Bohr to construct a
model for the hydrogen atom, based on the mathematics of planetary systems. If the electron in the hydrogen atom has a series of planetary-type
orbits available to it, it can be excited to an outer orbit and then can fall to
any one of the inner orbits, giving off energy corresponding to one of the
lines of Fig. 2–3. To develop the model, Bohr made several postulates:58 Chapter 2
1. Electrons exist in certain stable, circular orbits about the nucleus. This
assumption implies that the orbiting electron does not give off radiation as classical electromagnetic theory would normally require of
a charge experiencing angular acceleration; otherwise, the electron
would not be stable in the orbit but would spiral into the nucleus as
it lost energy by radiation.
2. The electron may shift to an orbit of higher or lower energy, thereby
gaining or losing energy equal to the difference in the energy levels
(by absorption or emission of a photon of energy hn).
hn = E2 - E1
(2–4)
3. The angular momentum pw of the electron in an orbit is always an
integral multiple of Planck’s constant divided by 2p (h>2p is often
abbreviated U for convenience). This assumption,
pw = nU, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, c (2–5)
is necessary to obtain the observed results of Fig. 2–3. Although
Bohr proposed this ad hoc relationship simply to explain the data,
one can see that this is equivalent to having an integer number of
de Broglie wavelengths ft within the circumference of the electron
orbit. These were called pilot waves, guiding the motion of the electrons around the nucleus. The de Broglie wave concept provided the
inspiration for the Schrödinger wave equation in quantum mechanics discussed in Section 2.4.
If we visualize the electron in a stable orbit of radius r about the proton
of the hydrogen atom, we can equate the electrostatic force between the
charges to the centripetal force:

where K = 4pP0 in MKS units, m is the mass of the electron, and v is its
velocity. From assumption 3 we have
pw = mvr = nU (2–7)
Since n takes on integral values, r should be denoted by rn to indicate
the nth orbit. Then Eq. (2–7) can be written
m2v2 = n2U2

for the radius of the nth orbit of the electron. Now we must find the expression for the total energy of the electron in this orbit, so that we can calculate

orbits correspond to the observed photon energies of the hydrogen60 Chapter 2

The pre-factor is essentially the Rydberg constant R times the speed of
light c. A comparison of Eq. (2–17) with the experimental results summed up
by Eq. (2–3) indicates that the Bohr theory provides a good model for electronic transitions within the hydrogen atom, as far as the early experimental
evidence is concerned.
Whereas the Bohr model accurately describes the gross features of
the hydrogen spectrum, it does not include many fine points. For example,
experimental evidence indicates some splitting of levels in addition to the
levels predicted by the theory. Also, difficulties arise in extending the model
to atoms more complicated than hydrogen. Attempts were made to modify
the Bohr model for more general cases, but it soon became obvious that a
more comprehensive theory was needed. However, the partial success of the
Bohr model was an important step toward the eventual development of the
quantum theory. The concept that electrons are quantized in certain allowed
energy levels, and the relationship of photon energy and transitions between
levels, had been established firmly by the Bohr theory.
The principles of quantum mechanics were developed from two different
points of view at about the same time (the late 1920s). One approach, developed by Heisenberg, utilizes the mathematics of matrices and is called matrix
mechanics. Independently, Schrödinger developed an approach utilizing a
wave equation, now called wave mechanics. These two mathematical formulations appear to be quite different. However, closer examination reveals
that beyond the formalism, the basic principles of the two approaches are the
same. It is possible to show, for example, that the results of matrix mechanics reduce to those of wave mechanics after mathematical manipulation. We
shall concentrate here on the wave mechanics approach, since solutions to
a few simple problems can be obtained with it, involving less mathematical
discussion.
2.4.1 Probability and the uncertainty Principle
It is impossible to describe with absolute precision events involving individual particles on the atomic scale. Instead, we must speak of the average
values (expectation values) of position, momentum, and energy of a particle
such as an electron. It is important to note, however, that the uncertainties
revealed in quantum calculations are not based on some shortcoming of the
theory. In fact, a major strength of the theory is that it describes the probabilistic nature of events involving atoms and electrons. The fact is that such
quantities as the position and momentum of an electron do not exist apart
from a particular uncertainty. The magnitude of this inherent uncertainty is
described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:1
1This is often called the principle of indeterminacy. This is a better term, since the parameters cannot be
determined with better accuracy than specified in these equations.
2.4
QuAntuM
MEchAnics62 Chapter 2
In any measurement of the position and momentum of a particle,
the uncertainties in the two measured quantities will be related by
(∆x) (∆px) Ú U>2 (2–18)
Similarly, the uncertainties in an energy measurement will be
related to the uncertainty in the time at which the measurement
was made by
(∆E) (∆t) Ú U>2 (2–19)
These limitations indicate that simultaneous measurement of position and momentum or of energy and time is inherently inaccurate to
some degree. Of course, Planck’s constant h is a rather small number
(6.63 * 10-34 J@s), and we are not concerned with this inaccuracy in the measurement of x and px for a truck, for example. On the other hand, measurements of the position of an electron and its speed are seriously limited by
the uncertainty principle.
One implication of the uncertainty principle is that we cannot properly
speak of the position of an electron, for example, but must look for the “probability” of finding an electron at a certain position. Thus one of the important
results of quantum mechanics is that a probability density function can be
obtained for a particle in a certain environment, and this function can be
used to find the expectation value of important quantities such as position,
momentum, and energy. We are familiar with the methods for calculating
discrete (single-valued) probabilities from common experience. For example,
it is clear that the probability of drawing a particular card out of a random
deck is 1⁄52, and the probability that a tossed coin will come up heads is 1⁄2.
The techniques for making predictions when the probability varies are less
familiar, however. In such cases it is common to define a probability of finding a particle within a certain volume. Given a probability density function
P(x) for a one-dimensional problem, the probability of finding the particle
in a range from x to x + dx is P(x)dx. Since the particle will be somewhere,
this definition implies that
L- ∞∞P(x)dx = 1 (2–20)
if the function P(x) is properly chosen. Equation (2–20) is implied by stating
that the function P(x) is normalized (i.e., the integral equals unity).
To find the average value of a function of x, we need only multiply the

particle in that dx and sum over all x. Thus the average value of f(x) is

2.4.2 the schrödinger Wave Equation
There are several ways to develop the wave equation by applying quantum
concepts to various classical equations of mechanics. One of the simplest
approaches is to consider a few basic postulates, develop the wave equation
from them, and rely on the accuracy of the results to serve as a justification
of the postulates. In more advanced texts these assumptions are dealt with
in more convincing detail.
Basic Postulates
1. Each particle in a physical system is described by a wavefunction °(x,
y, z, t). This function and its space derivative (0Ψ/0x + 0Ψ/0y + 0Ψ/0z)
are continuous, finite, and single valued.
2. In dealing with classical quantities such as energy E and momentum
p, we must relate these quantities with abstract quantum mechanical
operators defined in the following way:
Classical variable Quantum operator
x x
f(x) f(x)
p(x) U
j
0
0x
E
-
Uj
00t
and similarly for the other two directions.
3. The probability of finding a particle with wavefunction ° in the volume dx dy dz is °*° dx dy dz.2 The product °*° is normalized
according to Eq. (2–20) so that
L- ∞∞Ψ*Ψ dx dy dz = 1
and the average value 8Q9 of any variable Q is calculated from the
wavefunction by using the operator form Qop defned in postulate 2:
8Q9 = L- ∞∞Ψ*Qop Ψ dx dy dz
2°* is the complex conjugate of °, obtained by reversing the sign on each j. Thus, (ejx)* = e-jx.64 Chapter 2
Once we find the wavefunction ° for a particle, we can calculate its
average position, energy, and momentum, within the limits of the uncertainty
principle. Thus, a major part of the effort in quantum calculations involves
solving for ° within the conditions imposed by a particular physical system. We notice from assumption 3 that the probability density function is
°*°, or |°|2.
The classical equation for the energy of a particle can be written:
Kinetic energy + potential energy = total energy
1
2m p2 + V = E
(2–22)
In quantum mechanics we use the operator form for these variables
(postulate 2); the operators are allowed to operate on the wavefunction °. For
a one-dimensional problem Eq. (2–22) becomes3
-
U2
2m
02Ψ(x, t)
0x2 + V(x)Ψ(x, t) = - Uj 0Ψ(0xt , t) (2–23)
which is the Schrödinger wave equation. In three dimensions the equation is
-
U2
2m
∇2Ψ + VΨ = - U

0t
(2–24)
where §2° is
02Ψ
0x 2 +
02Ψ
0y2 +
02Ψ
0z2
The wavefunction ° in Eqs. (2–23) and (2–24) includes both space and
time dependencies. It is common to calculate these dependencies separately
and combine them later. Furthermore, many problems are time independent,
and only the space variables are necessary. Thus we try to solve the wave
equation by breaking it into two equations by the technique of separation
of variables. Let ° (x, t) be represented by the product e(x)h(t). Using this
product in Eq. (2–23) we obtain
-
U2
2m
02e(x)
0x2 f(t) + V(x)e(x)h(t) = - Uj e(x)0h0(tt) (2–25)
Now the variables can be separated to obtain the time-dependent
equation in one dimension,
dh(t)
dt +
jE
h h(t) = 0 (2–26a)
3The operational interpretation of (0>0x)2 is the second-derivative form 02>0x2; the square of j is -1.Atoms and Electrons 65
and the time-independent equation,
c - 2Um2 ddx22 + V(x) d e(x) = Ee(x) (2–26b)
This type of equation, where an operator operating on a function
equals a constant times the function, is known as an eigenvalue equation,
from the German word eigen meaning “proper.” We can show that the separation constant E corresponds to the total energy (kinetic plus potential) of
the particle. We get different eigenfunctions cn corresponding to different
eigenenergies, En. Since the time-dependent Equation (2–26a) is a first-order
differential equation, its solution is simply f(t) = exp (-jE>Ut) = exp (-jvt)
(using the Planck relation). This form is the universal time dependence of all
eigenfunctions.
We can show in quantum mechanics that any arbitrary wavefunction can
be written as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions, with pre-factors
or weighting coefficients that depend on the initial conditions. As an analogy,
remember that an arbitrary vector, V, can be expanded as a linear combination in terms of unit vectors or basis vectors along the x, y, and z axes:
V = V
xx + Vyy + Vzz (2–27a)
with coefficients V
x, Vy, and Vz.
A wavefunction can similarly be written as a linear combination of
various eigenfunctions, with appropriate pre-factors, each evolving in time
as shown above:
e(x, t) = a ncnen exp (-jEn/Ut) (2–27b)
Hence, eigenfunctions are sometimes also known as basis functions. But
unlike real vectors expandable in terms of three basis vectors in real space,
these eigenfunctions span an infinite number of dimensions in an abstract space
known as Hilbert space. If we measure the energy of the particle, we will get one
of these eigenenergies with a probability given by cn2. If we keep repeating these
measurements, each time we get a different eigenenergy with corresponding
probabilities, cn2. This leads to the famous uncertainties in quantum mechanics. The average of many quantum mechanical measurements will correspond
to the classical physics result. These equations are the basis of wave mechanics. From them we can determine the wavefunctions for particles in various
simple systems. The only thing that changes from one quantum mechanical
problem to the other is the form of V(x). For calculations involving electrons,
the potential term V(x) usually results from an electrostatic or magnetic field.
2.4.3 Potential Well Problem
It is quite difficult to find solutions to the Schrödinger equation for most
realistic potential fields. One can solve the problem with some effort for the
hydrogen atom, for example, but solutions for more complicated atoms are66 Chapter 2
hard to obtain. There are several important problems, however, which illustrate the theory without complicated manipulation. The simplest problem is
the potential energy well with infinite boundaries. Let us assume a particle
is trapped in a potential well with V(x) zero except at the boundaries x = 0
and L, where it is infinitely large (Fig. 2–5a):
V(x) = 0, 0 6 x 6 L
V(x) = ∞, x = 0, L (2–28)
Inside the well we set V(x) = 0 in Eq. (2–26b):
d2e(x)
dx2 +
2m
U2 Ee(x) = 0, 0 6 x 6 L (2–29)
This is the wave equation for a free particle; it applies to the potential
well problem in the region with no potential V(x).
Possible solutions to Eq. (2–29) are sin kx and cos kx, where k is
22mE > U. In choosing a solution, however, we must examine the boundary
conditions. The only allowable value of e at the walls is zero. Otherwise, there
would be a nonzero |e|2 outside the potential well, which is impossible because
a particle cannot penetrate an infinite barrier. Therefore, we must choose only
the sine solution and define k such that sin kx goes to zero at x = L:
e = A sin kx, k = 22mE
U
(2–30)
The constant A is the amplitude of the wavefunction and will be evaluated from the normalization condition (postulate 3). If e is to be zero at
x = L, then k must be some integral multiple of r/L:
k = n p
L , n = 1 , 2 , 3 , c (2–31)
From Eqs. (2–30) and (2–31) we can solve for the total energy En for
each value of the integer n:

Thus for each allowable value of n the particle energy is described by
Eq. (2–33). We notice that the energy is quantized. Only certain values of
energy are allowed. The integer n is called a quantum number; the particular
wavefunction en and corresponding energy state En describe the quantum
state of the particle.
The quantized energy levels described by Eq. (2–33) appear in a variety
of small-geometry structures encountered in semiconductor devices. We shall
return to this potential well problem (often called the “particle-in-a-box”
problem) in later discussions.
The constant A is found from postulate 3:
L- ∞∞e*e dx = L0 LA2 asin nLpxb 2dx = A2 L2 (2–34)
Setting Eq. (2–34) equal to unity we obtain
A = A L2 , en = A L2 sin nLpx (2–35)
The first three wavefunctions e1, e2, and e3 are sketched in Fig. 2–5b.
The probability density function e*e, or |e|2, is sketched for e2 in Fig. 2–5c.
Another useful form of the potential is V(x) = kx2, a parabolic potential well, which corresponds to the simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). The
shape of the wavefunctions and the eigenenergies are obviously going to be
different from the rectangular potential well above. The eigenenergies in
this case are found to be equally spaced, and given by En = (n + 1>2) Uv
for various positive integer values of n, corresponding to n quanta of these
SHO. In Chapter 3, we will discuss elastic waves in a lattice due to simple
harmonic oscillations of atoms in a parabolic inter-atomic potential, whose
quantized units are known as phonons (in analogy with the photons we discussed above). The energy of these phonons is given by Uv.

2.4.4 tunneling
The wavefunctions are relatively easy to obtain for the potential well with
infinite walls, since the boundary conditions force e to zero at the walls. A
slight modification of this problem illustrates a principle that is very important in some solid state devices—the quantum mechanical tunneling of an
electron through a barrier of finite height and thickness. Let us consider
the potential barrier of Fig. 2–6. If the barrier is not infinite, the boundary
conditions do not force e to zero at the barrier. Instead, we must use the
condition that e and its slope de>dx are continuous at each boundary of the
barrier (postulate 1). Thus e must have a nonzero value within the barrier
and also on the other side. Since e has a value to the right of the barrier,
e*e exists there also, implying that there is some probability of finding the
particle beyond the barrier. We notice that the particle does not go over
the barrier; its total energy is assumed to be less than the barrier height V0.
The mechanism by which the particle “penetrates” the barrier is called tunneling. However, no classical analog, including classical descriptions of tunneling through barriers, is appropriate for this effect. Quantum mechanical
tunneling is intimately bound to the uncertainty principle. If the barrier is
sufficiently thin, we cannot say with certainty that the particle exists only on
one side. However, the wavefunction amplitude for the particle is reduced by
the barrier as Fig. 2–6 indicates, so that by making the thickness W greater,
This is the de Broglie relationship. If we try to evaluate these integrals
directly, we run into the problem that both numerator and denominator
tend to infinity, because an ideal plane wave is strictly not a normalizable
wavefunction. The trick to use is to choose the limits of integration from,
say, -L>2 to + L>2 in a region of length L. The factor L cancels out in
the numerator and denominator. Then we can consider L approaches
infinity. For wavefunctions that are normalizable, such a mathematical
“trick” does not have to be used.
If we include the time dependence also, we get Ψ = A exp(jkxx-jvt).
We can also calculate the expectation value of the energy operator,

= (Uv) after normalization
which is the Planck relation.Atoms and Electrons 69
we can reduce e on the right-hand side to the point that negligible tunneling
occurs. Tunneling is important only over very small dimensions, but it can be
of great importance in the conduction of electrons in solids, as we shall see
in Chapters 5, 6, and 10.
A novel electronic device called the resonant tunneling diode has been
developed. This device operates by tunneling electrons through “particle in a
potential well” energy levels of the type described in Section 2.4.3.

The Schrödinger equation describes accurately the interactions of particles
with potential fields, such as electrons within atoms. Indeed, the modern
understanding of atomic theory (the modern atomic models) comes from
the wave equation and from Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics. It should be
pointed out, however, that the problem of solving the Schrödinger equation directly for complicated atoms is extremely difficult. In fact, only the
hydrogen atom is generally solved directly; atoms of atomic number greater
than one are usually handled by techniques involving approximations. Many
atoms such as the alkali metals (Li, Na, etc.), which have a neutral core with a
single electron in an outer orbit, can be treated by a rather simple extension
of the hydrogen atom results. The hydrogen atom solution is also important
in identifying the basic selection rules for describing allowed electron energy
levels. These quantum mechanical results must coincide with the experimental spectra, and we expect the energy levels to include those predicted by
the Bohr model. Without actually working through the mathematics for the
hydrogen atom, in this section we shall investigate the energy level schemes
dictated by the wave equation.

2.5.1 the hydrogen Atom
Finding the wavefunctions for the hydrogen atom requires a solution of
the Schrödinger equation in three dimensions for a Coulombic potential
field. Since the problem is spherically symmetric, the spherical coordinate
system is used in the calculation (Fig. 2–7). The term V(x, y, z) in Eq. (2–24)
must be replaced by V(r, u, h), representing the Coulomb potential which
the electron experiences in the vicinity of the proton. The Coulomb potential
varies only with r in spherical coordinates
V(r, w, h) = V(r) = -(4pg0)-1q2
r
(2–36)
as in Eq. (2–14).
When the separation of variables is made, the time-independent equation can be written as
e(r, w, h) = R(r)Θ(w)Φ(h) (2–37)
Thus the wavefunctions are found in three parts. Separate solutions
must be obtained for the r-dependent equation, the u-dependent equation,
and the f-dependent equation. After these three equations are solved, the
total wavefunction c is obtained from the product.
As in the simple potential well problem, each of the three hydrogen
atom equations gives a solution which is quantized. Thus we would expect a
quantum number to be associated with each of the three parts of the wave
equation. As an illustration, the f-dependent equation obtained after separation of variables is

where m is a quantum number. The solution to this equation is
Φ
m(h) = Aejmh (2–39)
where A can be evaluated by the normalization condition, as before:
L0 2pΦ* m(h)Φm(h)dh = 1 (2–40)
A2 L0 2re-jmhejmh dh = A2 L0 2rdh = 2rA2 (2–41)
Thus the value of A is
A = 1
22r (2–42)
and the f-dependent wavefunction is
Φ
m(h) = 1
22pejmh (2–43)
Since values of h repeat every 2r radians, Φ should repeat also. This
occurs if m is an integer, including negative integers and zero. Thus the wavefunctions for the h-dependent equation are quantized with the following
selection rule for the quantum numbers:
m = c , -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, c (2–44)
By similar treatments, the functions R(r) and Θ(w) can be obtained,
each being quantized by its own selection rule. For the r-dependent equation, the quantum number n can be any positive integer (not zero), and for
the u-dependent equation the quantum number l can be zero or a positive integer. However, there are interrelationships among the equations
which restrict the various quantum numbers used with a single wavefunction cnlm:
enlm(r, w, h) = Rn(r)Θl(w)Φm(h) (2–45)
These restrictions are summarized as follows:
n = 1, 2, 3, c (2–46a)
l = 0, 1, 2, c , (n - 1) (2–46b)
m = -l, c , -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, c , +l (2–46c)
In addition to the three quantum numbers arising from the three parts
of the wave equation, there is an important quantization condition on the
“spin” of the electron. Investigations of electron spin employ the theory of72 Chapter 2
relativity as well as quantum mechanics; therefore, we shall simply state that
the intrinsic angular momentum s of an electron with enlm specified is
s = { U
2
(2–47)
That is, in units of U, the electron has a spin of 1 2, and the angular momentum produced by this spin is positive or negative depending on whether the
electron is “spin up” or “spin down.” The important point for our discussion
is that each allowed energy state of the electron in the hydrogen atom is
uniquely described by four quantum numbers: n, l, m and s.4
Using these four quantum numbers, we can identify the various states
which the electron can occupy in a hydrogen atom. The number n, called
the principal quantum number, specifies the “orbit” of the electron in Bohr
terminology. Of course, the concept of orbit is replaced by probability density functions in quantum mechanical calculations. It is common to refer to
states with a given principal quantum number as belonging to a shell rather
than an orbit.
There is considerable fine structure in the energy levels about the Bohr
orbits, due to the dictates of the other three quantum conditions. For example,
an electron with n = 1 (the first Bohr orbit) can have only l = 0 and m = 0
according to Eq. (2–46), but there are two spin states allowed from
Eq. (2–47). For n = 2 , l can be 0 or 1, and m can be -1, 0, or +1. The various allowed combinations of quantum numbers appear in the first four columns of Table 2–1. From these combinations it is apparent that the electron
in a hydrogen atom can occupy any one of a large number of excited states
in addition to the lowest (ground) state c100. Energy differences between
the various states properly account for the observed lines in the hydrogen
spectrum.
2.5.2 the Periodic table
The quantum numbers discussed in Section 2.5.1 arise from the solutions to
the hydrogen atom problem. Thus the energies obtainable from the wavefunctions are unique to the hydrogen atom and cannot be extended to more
complicated atoms without appropriate alterations. However, the quantum
number selection rules are valid for more complicated structures, and we
can use these rules to gain an understanding of the arrangement of atoms in
the periodic table of chemical elements. Without these selection rules, it is
difficult to understand why only two electrons fit into the first Bohr orbit of
an atom, whereas eight electrons are allowed in the second orbit. After even
the brief discussion of quantum numbers given above, we should be able to
answer these questions with more insight.
Before discussing the periodic table, we must be aware of an important
principle of quantum theory, the Pauli exclusion principle. This rule states
4In many texts, the numbers we have called m and s are referred to as ml and ms, respectively.Atoms and Electrons 73
that no two electrons in an interacting system5 can have the same set of quantum numbers n, l, m, and s. In other words, only two electrons can have the
same three quantum numbers n, l, and m, and those two must have opposite
spin. The importance of this principle cannot be overemphasized; it is basic
to the electronic structure of all atoms in the periodic table. One implication of this principle is that by listing the various combinations of quantum
numbers, we can determine into which shell each electron of a complicated
atom fits, and how many electrons are allowed per shell. The quantum states
summarized in Table 2–1 can be used to indicate the electronic configurations for atoms in the lowest energy state.
In the first electronic shell (n = 1), l can be only zero since the maximum value of l is always n - 1. Similarly, m can be only zero since m runs
from the negative value of l to the positive value of l. Two electrons with
opposite spin can fit in this c100 state; therefore, the first shell can have at
most two electrons. For the helium atom (atomic number Z = 2) in the
table 2–1 Quantum numbers to n = 3 and allowable states for the electron in a hydrogen
atom: The first four columns show the various combinations of quantum numbers allowed by
the selection rules of Eq. (2–46); the last two columns indicate the number of allowed states
(combinations of n, l, m, and s) for each l (subshell) and n (shell, or Bohr orbit).

ground state, both electrons will be in the first Bohr orbit (n = 1 ), both will
have l = 0 and m = 0 , and they will have opposite spin. Of course, one or
both of the He atom electrons can be excited to one of the higher energy
states of Table 2–1 and subsequently relax to the ground state, giving off a
photon characteristic of the He spectrum.Atoms and Electrons 75
As Table 2–1 indicates, there can be two electrons in the l = 0 subshell,
six electrons when l = 1, and ten electrons for l = 2. The electronic configurations of various atoms in the periodic table can be deduced from this list of
allowed states. The ground state electron structures for a number of atoms
are listed in Table 2–2. There is a simple shorthand notation for electronic
structures which is commonly used instead of such a table. The only new
convention to remember in this notation is the naming of the l values:
l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, c
s, p, d, f, g, c
This convention was created by early spectroscopists who referred
to the first four spectral groups as sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental. Alphabetical order is used beyond f. With this convention for l, we can
write an electron state as follows:
6 electrons in the 3p subshell
3p6
(n = 3) (l = 1)
For example, the total electronic configuration for Si (Z = 1 4 ) in the
ground state is
1s22s22p63s23p2
We notice that Si has a closed Ne configuration (see Table 2–2) plus
four electrons in an outer n = 3 orbit (3s23p2). These are the four valence
electrons of Si; two valence electrons are in an s state and two are in a p
state. The Si electronic configuration can be written [Ne] 3s23p2 for convenience, since the Ne configuration 1s22s22p6 forms a closed shell (typical of
the inert elements).
Figure 2–8a shows the orbital model of a Si atom, which has a nucleus
consisting of 14 protons (with a charge of +14) and neutrons, 10 core electrons
in shells n = 1 and 2, and 4 valence electrons in the 3s and 3p subshells. Figure
2–8b shows the energy levels of the various electrons in the Coulombic potential well of the nucleus. Since unlike charges attract each other, there is an
attractive potential between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nucleus. As indicated in Eq. (2–36), a Coulomb potential varies
as 1 >r as a function of distance from the charge, in this case the Si nucleus. The
potential energy gradually goes to zero when we approach infinity. We end up
getting “particle-in-a-box” states for these electrons in this potential well, as
discussed in Section 2.4.3 and Eq. (2–33). Of course, in this case the shape of
the potential well is not rectangular, as shown in Fig. 2–5a, but Coulombic, as
shown in Fig. 2–8b. Therefore, the energy levels have a form closer to those of
the H atom as shown in Eq. (2–15), rather than in Eq. (2–33).
If we solve the Schrödinger equation for the Si atom as we did in
Section 2.5.1 for the H atom, we can get the radial and angular dependence ofValence

the wavefunctions or “orbitals” of the electrons. Let us focus on the valence
shell, n = 3 , where we have two 3s and two 3p electrons. It turns out that
the 3s orbital is spherically symmetric with no angular dependence, and is
positive everywhere. It can hold 2 electrons with opposite spin according to
the Pauli principle. There are 3p orbitals which are mutually perpendicular. These are shaped like dumbbells with a positive lobe and a negative lobe
(Fig. 2–9). The 3p subshell can hold up to 6 electrons, but in the case of Si
has only 2. Interestingly, in a Si crystal when we bring individual atoms very
close together, the s and p orbitals overlap so much that they lose their distinct character, and lead to four mixed sp3 orbitals. The negative part of the
p orbital cancels the s-type wavefunction, while the positive part enhances
it, thereby leading to a “directed” bond in space. As shown in Fig. 2–9, these
linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) or “hybridized” sp3 orbitals point symmetrically in space along the four tetragonal directions (see
Fig. 1–9). In Chapter 3 we shall see that these “directed” chemical bonds
are responsible for the tetragonal diamond or zinc blende lattice structure
in most semiconductors. They are also very important in the understanding
of energy bands, and in the conduction of charges in these semiconductors.
The column IV semiconductor Ge (Z = 3 2 ) has an electronic structure similar to Si, except that the four valence electrons are outside a closed
n = 3 shell. Thus the Ge configuration is [Ar] 3d104s24p2. There are several cases in Table 2–2 that do not follow the most straightforward choice
of quantum numbers. For example, we notice that in K (Z = 1 9 ) and Ca
(Z = 2 0 ) the 4s state is filled before the 3d state; in Cr (Z = 2 4 ) and Cu
(Z = 2 9 ) there is a transfer of an electron back to the 3d state. These exceptions, required by minimum energy considerations, are discussed more fully
in most atomic physics texts.

2.1 In classical physics, matter (including electrons) was described as particles by suMMAry
Newtonian mechanics, while light was described as waves, consistent with phenomena such as interference and diffraction of light.
2.2 Phenomena such as blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect forced
Planck and Einstein to introduce a particle aspect to light (photons). Analysis
of atomic spectra then led Bohr and de Broglie to analogously introduce a
wave aspect to subatomic particles such as electrons. This led to a wave–particle78 Chapter 2
duality and a quantum mechanical description of nature by Heisenberg and
Schrödinger.
2.3 To understand how electrons move in semiconductor devices or interact with
light, we need to determine a complex wavefunction of the electron. The wavefunction has to be mathematically well behaved, consistent with the interpretation that the wavefunction magnitude squared is the probability density of
finding the electron in space and time.
2.4 We get the wavefunction by solving Schrödinger’s time-dependent partial
differential equation. The application of boundary conditions (the potential
energy profile) allows certain (proper) eigenfunctions as valid solutions, with
corresponding eigenenergies, determined by allowed quantum numbers. Results
of physical measurements are no longer deterministic (as in classical mechanics), but probabilistic, with an expectation value given by an average using the
wavefunction of appropriate quantum mechanical operators corresponding to
physical quantities.
2.5 Application of these principles to the simplest atom (H) introduces four
quantum numbers—n, l, m, and s, which are subject to appropriate quantum
mechanical rules. Extrapolating these ideas to more complicated atoms such
as Si leads to the idea of electronic structure and the periodic table, if we apply
the Pauli exclusion principle that one can have a maximum of one electron for
one set of these quantum numbers.

Energy Bands and Charge
Carriers in Semiconductors
In this chapter we begin to discuss the specific mechanisms by which current flows in a solid. In examining these mechanisms we shall learn why
some materials are good conductors of electric current, whereas others are
poor conductors. We shall see how the conductivity of a semiconductor can
be varied by changing the temperature or the number of impurities. These
fundamental concepts of charge transport form the basis for later discussions
of solid state device behavior.

2. Appreciate the idea of doping in semiconductors
3. Use the density of states and Fermi Dirac statistics to calculate carrier
concentrations
4. Calculate drift currents in an electric field in terms of carrier mobility,
and how mobility is affected by scattering
5. Discuss the idea of “effective” masses
In Chapter 2 we found that electrons are restricted to sets of discrete energy
levels within atoms. Large gaps exist in the energy scale in which no energy
states are available. In a similar fashion, electrons in solids are restricted to
certain energies and are not allowed at other energies. The basic difference
between the case of an electron in a solid and that of an electron in an isolated
atom is that in the solid the electron has a range, or band, of available energies.
The discrete energy levels of the isolated atom spread into bands of energies
in the solid because in the solid the wavefunctions of electrons in neighboring
atoms overlap, and an electron is not necessarily localized at a particular atom.
Thus, for example, an electron in the outer orbit of one atom feels the influence
of neighboring atoms, and its overall wavefunction is altered. Naturally, this
influence affects the potential energy term and the boundary conditions in the
3.1

FOrCES and
EnErgy BandS
in SOlidS84 Chapter 3
Schrödinger equation, and we would expect to obtain different energies in the
solution. Usually, the influence of neighboring atoms on the energy levels of
a particular atom can be treated as a small perturbation, giving rise to shifting
and splitting of energy states into energy bands.
3.1.1 Bonding Forces in Solids
The interaction of electrons in neighboring atoms of a solid serves the
very important function of holding the crystal together. For example,
alkali halides such as NaCl are typified by ionic bonding. In the NaCl

and 1–9).Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 85
lattice, each Na atom is surrounded by six nearest neighbor Cl atoms, and
vice versa. Four of the nearest neighbors are evident in the two-dimensional representation shown in Fig. 3–1a. The electronic structure of Na
(Z = 11) is [Ne] 3s1, and Cl (Z = 17) has the structure [Ne] 3s23p5. In the
lattice each Na atom gives up its outer 3s electron to a Cl atom, so that the
crystal is made up of ions with the electronic structures of the inert atoms
Ne and Ar (Ar has the electronic structure [Ne] 3s23p6). However, the ions
have net electric charges after the electron exchange. The Na+ ion has a net
positive charge, having lost an electron, and the Cl - ion has a net negative
charge, having gained an electron.
Each Na+ ion exerts an electrostatic attractive force upon its six Cl -
neighbors, and vice versa. These coulombic forces pull the lattice together
until a balance is reached with repulsive forces. A reasonably accurate calculation of the atomic spacing can be made by considering the ions as hard
spheres being attracted together (Example 1–1).
An important observation in the NaCl structure is that all electrons
are tightly bound to atoms. Once the electron exchanges have been made
between the Na and Cl atoms to form the Na+ and Cl - ions, the outer orbits
of all atoms are completely filled. Since the ions have the closed-shell configurations of the inert atoms Ne and Ar, there are no loosely bound electrons
to participate in current flow; as a result, NaCl is a good insulator.
In a metal atom the outer electronic shell is only partially filled, usually by no more than three electrons. We have already noted that the alkali
metals (e.g., Na) have only one electron in the outer orbit. This electron is
loosely bound and is given up easily in ion formation. This accounts for the
great chemical activity in the alkali metals, as well as for their high electrical conductivity. In the metal the outer electron of each alkali atom is contributed to the crystal as a whole, so that the solid is made up of ions with
closed shells immersed in a sea of free electrons. The forces holding the lattice together arise from an interaction between the positive ion cores and the
surrounding free electrons. This is one type of metallic bonding. Obviously,
there are complicated differences in the bonding forces for various metals, as evidenced by the wide range of melting temperatures (234 K for Hg,
3643 K for W). However, the metals have the sea of electrons in common,
and these electrons are free to move about the crystal under the influence
of an electric field.
A third type of bonding is exhibited by the diamond lattice semiconductors. We recall that each atom in the Ge, Si, or C diamond lattice
is surrounded by four nearest neighbors, each with four electrons in the
outer orbit. In these crystals each atom shares its valence electrons with
its four neighbors (Fig. 3–1b). Bonding between nearest neighbor atoms is
illustrated in the diamond lattice diagram of Fig. 1–9. The bonding forces
arise from a quantum mechanical interaction between the shared electrons.
This is known as covalent bonding; each electron pair constitutes a covalent
bond. In the sharing process it is no longer relevant to ask which electron
belongs to a particular atom—both belong to the bond. The two electrons86 Chapter 3
are indistinguishable, except that they must have opposite spin to satisfy
the Pauli exclusion principle. Covalent bonding is also found in certain molecules, such as H2.
As in the case of the ionic crystals, no free electrons are available to
the lattice in the covalent diamond structure of Fig. 3–1b. By this reasoning
Ge and Si should also be insulators. However, we have pictured an idealized
lattice at 0 K in this figure. As we shall see in subsequent sections, an electron
can be thermally or optically excited out of a covalent bond and thereby
become free to participate in conduction. This is an important feature of
semiconductors.
Compound semiconductors such as GaAs have mixed bonding, in
which both ionic and covalent bonding forces participate. Some ionic bonding is to be expected in a crystal such as GaAs because of the difference in
placement of the Ga and As atoms in the periodic table. The ionic character of the bonding becomes more important as the atoms of the compound
become further separated in the periodic table, as in the II–VI compounds.
Such electronic structure, and specifically the idea that the outermost valence
shell is complete if it has a stable set of eight electrons (Ne, Ar, Kr), is the
basis of most of chemistry and many of the semiconducting properties.
3.1.2 Energy Bands
As isolated atoms are brought together to form a solid, various interactions
occur between neighboring atoms, including those described in the preceding section. The forces of attraction and repulsion between atoms will find
a balance at the proper interatomic spacing for the crystal. In the process,
important changes occur in the electron energy level configurations, and
these changes result in the varied electrical properties of solids.
In Fig. 2–8, we showed the orbital model of a Si atom, along with the
energy levels of the various electrons in the coulombic potential well of the
nucleus. Let us focus on the outermost shell or valence shell, n = 3, where
two 3s and two 3p electrons interact to form the four “hybridized” sp3 electrons when the atoms are brought close together. In Fig. 3–2, we schematically show the coulombic potential wells of two atoms close to each other,
along with the wavefunctions of two electrons centered on the two nuclei. By
solving the Schrödinger equation for such an interacting system, we find that
the composite two-electron wavefunctions are linear combinations of the
individual atomic orbitals (LCAO). The odd or antisymmetric combination
is called the antibonding orbital, while the even or symmetric combination is
the bonding orbital. It can be seen that the bonding orbital has a higher value
of the wavefunction (and therefore the electron probability density) than the
antibonding state in the region between the two nuclei. This corresponds to
the covalent bond between the atoms.
Fundamental particles in nature have either integer spin and are called
bosons (e.g., photons), or half-integer spin and are known as fermions (e.g.,
electrons). The quantum mechanical wavefunction of the electron has aEnergy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 87
spatial (or orbital) part and a spin-dependent part. It can be shown that fermion wavefunctions of a multi-electron system must be antisymmetric. When
the spatial part is symmetric, the electron spins must be anti-parallel, and vice
versa. Hence, the two electrons in the bonding orbital have opposite spins,
while those in the anti-bonding state have parallel spins. This “explains” the
Pauli exclusion principle. When we try to put two electrons into a quantum state, they must have opposite spins. Parallel spin electrons quantum
mechanically repel each other, as seen for the antisymmetric orbital. (This
should not be confused with Coulomb repulsion of the electrons.) Later on
in Chapter 10, we will see that these concepts have important ramifications
for nanoelectronics. To determine the energy levels of the bonding and the
antibonding states, it is important to recognize that in the region between
the two nuclei the Coulombic potential energy V(r) is lowered (solid line in
Fig. 3–2) compared to isolated atoms (dashed lines). It is easy to see why the
potential energy would be lowered in this region, because an electron here
would be attracted by two nuclei, rather than just one. For the bonding state
the electron probability density is higher in this region of lowered potential
energy than for the antibonding state. As a result, the original isolated atomic

Linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO): The LCAO when two atoms are brought together leads
to two distinct “normal” modes—a higher energy antibonding orbital, and a lower energy bonding
orbital. Note that the electron probability density is high in the region between the ion cores (covalent
“bond”), leading to lowering of the bonding energy level and the cohesion of the crystal. If instead of
two atoms, one brings together N atoms, there will be N distinct LCAO, and N closely spaced energy
levels in a band.88 Chapter 3
energy level would be split into two, a lower bonding energy level and a
higher antibonding level. It is the lowering of the energy of the bonding
state that gives rise to cohesion of the crystal. For even smaller interatomic
spacings, the energy of the crystal goes up because of repulsion between the
nuclei, and other electronic interactions. Since the probability density is given
by the square of the wavefunction, if the entire wavefunction is multiplied
by -1, it does not lead to a different LCAO. The important point to note
in this discussion is that the number of distinct LCAO, and the number of
distinct energy levels, depends on the number of atoms that are brought
together. The lowest energy level corresponds to the totally symmetric
LCAO, the highest corresponds to the totally antisymmetric case, and the
other combinations lead to energy levels in between.
Qualitatively, we can see that as atoms are brought together, the application of the Pauli exclusion principle becomes important. When two atoms
are completely isolated from each other so that there is no interaction of
electron wavefunctions between them, they can have identical electronic
structures. As the spacing between the two atoms becomes smaller, however,
electron wavefunctions begin to overlap. The exclusion principle dictates
that no two electrons in a given interacting system may have the same quantum state; thus there must be at most one electron per level after there is a
splitting of the discrete energy levels of the isolated atoms into new levels
belonging to the pair rather than to individual atoms.
In a solid, many atoms are brought together, so that the split energy
levels form essentially continuous bands of energies. As an example,
Fig. 3–3 illustrates the imaginary formation of a silicon crystal from isolated
silicon atoms. Each isolated silicon atom has an electronic structure 1s22s2
2p63s23p2 in the ground state. Each atom has available two 1s states, two 2s
states, six 2p states, two 3s states, six 3p states, and higher states (see Tables
2–1 and 2–2). If we consider N atoms, there will be 2N, 2N, 6N, 2N, and 6N
states of type 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p, respectively. As the interatomic spacing decreases, these energy levels split into bands, beginning with the outer
(n = 3) shell. As the “3s” and “3p” bands grow, they merge into a single band
composed of a mixture of energy levels. This band of “3s–3p” levels contains
8N available states. As the distance between atoms approaches the equilibrium interatomic spacing of silicon, this band splits into two bands separated
by an energy gap Eg. The upper band (called the conduction band) contains
4N states, as does the lower (valence) band. Thus, apart from the low-lying
and tightly bound “core” levels, the silicon crystal has two bands of available
energy levels separated by an energy gap Eg wide, which contains no allowed
energy levels for electrons to occupy. This gap is sometimes called a “forbidden band,” since in a perfect crystal it contains no electron energy states.
We should pause at this point and count electrons. The lower “1s” band
is filled with the 2N electrons which originally resided in the collective 1s
states of the isolated atoms. Similarly, the 2s band and the 2p bands will have
2N and 6N electrons in them, respectively. However, there were 4N electrons
in the original isolated n = 3 shells (2N in 3s states and 2N in 3p states).Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 89
These 4N electrons must occupy states in the valence band or the conduction
band in the crystal. At 0 K the electrons will occupy the lowest energy states
available to them. In the case of the Si crystal, there are exactly 4N states
in the valence band available to the 4N electrons. Thus at 0 K, every state in
the valence band will be filled, while the conduction band will be completely
empty of electrons. As we shall see, this arrangement of completely filled and
empty energy bands has an important effect on the electrical conductivity
of the solid.
3.1.3 Metals, Semiconductors, and insulators
Every solid has its own characteristic energy band structure. This variation
in band structure is responsible for the wide range of electrical characteristics observed in various materials. The silicon band structure of Fig. 3–3,
for example, can give a good picture of why silicon in the diamond lattice is
a good insulator. To reach such a conclusion, we must consider the properties of completely filled and completely empty energy bands in the current
conduction process.

Figure 3–3
Energy levels in Si as a function of interatomic spacing. The core levels (n = 1, 2) in Si are completely
filled with electrons. At the actual atomic spacing of the crystal, the 2N electrons in the 3s subshell and
the 2N electrons in the 3p subshell undergo sp3 hybridization, and all end up in the lower 4N states
(valence band), while the higher-lying 4N states (conduction band) are empty, separated by a band gap.90 Chapter 3
Before discussing the mechanisms of current flow in solids further, we
can observe here that for electrons to experience acceleration in an applied
electric field, they must be able to move into new energy states. This implies
there must be empty states (allowed energy states which are not already
occupied by electrons) available to the electrons. For example, if relatively
few electrons reside in an otherwise empty band, ample unoccupied states
are available into which the electrons can move. On the other hand, the
silicon band structure is such that the valence band is completely filled with
electrons at 0 K and the conduction band is empty. There can be no charge
transport within the valence band, since no empty states are available into
which electrons can move. There are no electrons in the conduction band,
so no charge transport can take place there either. Thus silicon at 0 K has a
high resistivity typical of insulators.
Semiconductor materials at 0 K have basically the same structure as
insulators—a filled valence band separated from an empty conduction band
by a band gap containing no allowed energy states (Fig. 3–4). The difference
lies in the size of the band gap Eg , which is much smaller in semiconductors
than in insulators. For example, the semiconductor Si has a band gap of about
1.1 eV compared with 5 eV for diamond. The relatively small band gaps of
semiconductors (Appendix III) allow for excitation of electrons from the
lower (valence) band to the upper (conduction) band by reasonable amounts
of thermal or optical energy. For example, at room temperature a semiconductor with a 1-eV band gap will have a significant number of electrons
excited thermally across the energy gap into the conduction band, whereas
an insulator with E
g = 10 eV will have a negligible number of such excitations. Thus an important difference between semiconductors and insulators
is that the number of electrons available for conduction can be increased
greatly in semiconductors by thermal or optical energy.
In metals the bands either overlap or are only partially filled. Thus
electrons and empty energy states are intermixed within the bands so
that electrons can move freely under the influence of an electric field. As
expected from the metallic band structures of Fig. 3–4, metals have a high
electrical conductivity.
3.1.4 direct and indirect Semiconductors
The “thought experiment” of Section 3.1.2, in which isolated atoms were
brought together to form a solid, is useful in pointing out the existence of
energy bands and some of their properties. Other techniques are generally
used, however, when quantitative calculations are made of band structures.
In a typical calculation, a single electron is assumed to travel through a perfectly periodic lattice. The wavefunction of the electron is assumed to be
in the form of a plane wave1 moving, for example, in the x-direction with
1Discussions of plane waves are available in most sophomore physics texts or in introductory
electromagnetics texts.Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 91
propagation constant k, also called a wavevector. The space-dependent wavefunction for the electron is
ek(x) = U(kx, x)e j kxx (3–1)
where the function U(kx, x) modulates the wavefunction according to the
periodicity of the lattice. Such wavefunctions are called Bloch functions after
the physicist Felix Bloch.
In such a calculation, allowed values of energy can be plotted vs. the
propagation constant k. Since the periodicity of most lattices is different in
various directions, the (E, k) diagram must be plotted for the various crystal
directions, and the full relationship between E and k is a complex surface
which should be visualized in three dimensions.
The band structure of GaAs has a minimum in the conduction band
and a maximum in the valence band for the same k value (k = 0). On the
other hand, Si has its valence band maximum at a different value of k than
its conduction band minimum. Thus an electron making a smallest-energy
transition from the conduction band to the valence band in GaAs can do so
without a change in k value; on the other hand, a transition from the minimum point in the Si conduction band to the maximum point of the valence
band requires some change in k. Thus there are two classes of semiconductor energy bands: direct and indirect (Fig. 3–5). We can show that an indirect
transition, involving a change in k, requires a change of momentum for the
electron.
The direct and indirect semiconductors are identified in Appendix III.
In a direct semiconductor such as GaAs, an electron in the conduction band
can fall to an empty state in the valence band, giving off the energy difference E
g as a photon of light. On the other hand, an electron in the conduction
band minimum of an indirect semiconductor such as Si cannot fall directly to
the valence band maximum but must undergo a momentum change as well

as changing its energy. For example, it may go through some defect state (Et)
within the band gap. We shall discuss such defect states in Sections 4.2.1 and
4.3.2. In an indirect transition which involves a change in k, part of the energy
is generally given up as heat to the lattice rather than as an emitted photon.
This difference between direct and indirect band structures is very important
for deciding which semiconductors can be used in devices requiring light
output. For example, semiconductor light emitters and lasers (Chapter 8)
generally must be made of materials capable of direct band-to-band transitions or of indirect materials with vertical transitions between defect states.
Band diagrams such as those shown in Fig. 3–5 are cumbersome to
draw in analyzing devices, and do not provide a view of the variation of electron energy with distance in the sample. Therefore, in most discussions we
shall use simple band pictures such as those shown in Fig. 3–4, remembering
that electron transitions across the band gap may be direct or indirect.
3.1.5 variation of Energy Bands with alloy Composition
As III–V ternary and quaternary alloys are varied over their composition
ranges (see Sections 1.2.4 and 1.4.1), their band structures change. For example,
Fig. 3–6 illustrates the band structure of GaAs and AlAs, and the way in which
the bands change with composition x in the ternary compound AlxGa1–xAs.
The binary compound GaAs is a direct material, with a band gap of 1.43 eV at
room temperature. For reference, we call the direct (k = 0 ) conduction band
minimum Г. There are also two higher-lying indirect minima in the GaAs conduction band, but these are sufficiently far above Г that few electrons reside
there (we discuss an important exception in Chapter 10 in which high-field
excitation of electrons into the indirect minima leads to the Gunn effect).
We call the lowest-lying GaAs indirect minimum L and the other X. In AlAs
the direct Г minimum is much higher than the indirect X minimum, and this
material is therefore indirect with a band gap of 2.16 eV at room temperature.

diagram for GaAs, showing three minima in the conduction band; (b) AlAs band diagram; (c) positions
of the three conduction band minima in Al
xGa1–xAs as x varies over the range of compositions from
GaAs (x = 0) to AlAs (x = 1). The smallest band gap, Eg (shown in color), follows the direct Ω band to
x = 0.38, and then follows the indirect X band.94 Chapter 3
In the ternary alloy AlxGal–xAs all of these conduction band minima
move up relative to the valence band as the composition x varies from 0
(GaAs) to 1 (AlAs). However, the indirect minimum X moves up less than
the others, and for compositions above about 38 percent Al this indirect minimum becomes the lowest-lying conduction band. Therefore, the ternary alloy
AlGaAs is a direct semiconductor for Al compositions on the column III
sublattice up to about 38 percent, and is an indirect semiconductor for higher
Al mole fractions. The band gap energy Eg is shown in color on Fig. 3–6c.
The variation of energy bands for the ternary alloy GaAs1–xPx is generally similar to that of AlGaAs shown in Fig. 3–6. GaAsP is a direct semiconductor from GaAs to about GaAs.55P.45 and is indirect from this composition
to GaP (see Fig. 8–11). This material is often used in visible LEDs.
Since light emission is most efficient for direct materials, in which
electrons can drop from the conduction band to the valence band without
changing k (and therefore momentum), LEDs in GaAsP are generally made
in materials grown with a composition less than x = 0 .4 5 . For example,
most red LEDs in this material are made at about x = 0 .4 , where the
Ω minimum is still the lowest-lying conduction band edge, and where the
photon resulting from a direct transition from this band to the valence band
is in the red portion of the spectrum (about 1.9 eV). The use of impurities
to enhance radiative recombination in indirect material will be discussed
in Section 8.2.
The mechanism of current conduction is relatively easy to visualize in the
case of a metal; the metal atoms are imbedded in a “sea” of relatively free
electrons, and these electrons can move as a group under the influence of an
electric field. This free electron view is oversimplified, but many important
conduction properties of metals can be derived from just such a model.
However, we cannot account for all of the electrical properties of semiconductors in this way. Since the semiconductor has a filled valence band
and an empty conduction band at 0 K, we must consider the increase in
conduction band electrons by thermal excitations across the band gap as
the temperature is raised. In addition, after electrons are excited to the
conduction band, the empty states left in the valence band can contribute
to the conduction process. The introduction of impurities has an important
effect on the energy band structure and on the availability of charge carriers.
Thus there is considerable flexibility in controlling the electrical properties
of semiconductors.
3.2.1 Electrons and Holes
As the temperature of a semiconductor is raised from 0 K, some electrons
in the valence band receive enough thermal energy to be excited across the
band gap to the conduction band. The result is a material with some electrons in an otherwise empty conduction band and some unoccupied states in
3.2
CHargE

in SEMiCOnduCtOrSEnergy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 95
an otherwise filled valence band (Fig. 3–7).2 For convenience, an empty state
in the valence band is referred to as a hole. If the conduction band electron
and the hole are created by the excitation of a valence band electron to the
conduction band, they are called an electron–hole pair (abbreviated EHP).
After excitation to the conduction band, an electron is surrounded by
a large number of unoccupied energy states. For example, the equilibrium
number of EHPs in pure Si at room temperature is only about 1010 EHP/cm3,
compared to the Si atom density of 5 * 1 0 2 2 atoms/cm3. Thus the few electrons in the conduction band are free to move about via the many available
empty states.
The corresponding problem of charge transport in the valence band is
somewhat more complicated. However, it is possible to show that the effects
of current in a valence band containing holes can be accounted for by simply
keeping track of the holes themselves.
In a filled band, all available energy states are occupied. For every
electron moving with a given velocity, there is an equal and opposite electron
motion elsewhere in the band. If we apply an electric field, the net current
is zero because for every electron j moving with velocity vj there is a corresponding electron j′ with velocity –vj . Figure 3–8 illustrates this effect in
2In Fig. 3–7 and in subsequent discussions, we refer to the bottom of the conduction band as Ec and the
top of the valence band as Ev.

terms of the electron energy vs. wavevector plot for the valence band. Since
k is proportional to electron momentum, it is clear the two electrons have
oppositely directed velocities. With N electrons/cm3 in the band we express
the current density using a sum over all of the electron velocities, and including the charge –q on each electron. In a unit volume,
J = (-q) a
N i
vi = 0 ( filled band) (3–2a)
Now if we create a hole by removing the jth electron, the net current
density in the valence band involves the sum over all velocities, minus the
contribution of the electron we have removed:
J = (-q) a
N i
vi - (-q)vj ( jth electron missing) (3–2b)
But the first term is zero, from Eq. (3–2a). Thus the net current is +qvj.
In other words, the current contribution of the hole is equivalent to that of
a positively charged particle with velocity vj, that of the missing electron.
Of course, the charge transport is actually due to the motion of the new
uncompensated electron ( j′). Its current contribution (–q) (–vj) is equivalent
to that of a positively charged particle with velocity +vj. For simplicity, it is
customary to treat empty states in the valence band as charge carriers with
positive charge and positive mass.
A simple analogy may help in understanding the behavior of holes. If
we have two bottles, one completely filled with water and one completely
empty, we can ask ourselves “Will there be any net transport of water when
we tilt the bottles?” The answer is “no.” In the case of the empty bottle, the
answer is obvious. In the case of the completely full bottle also, there cannot be any net motion of water because there is no empty space for water
to move into. Similarly, an empty conduction band completely devoid of
electrons or a valence band completely full of electrons cannot give rise to a
net motion of electrons, and thus to current conduction.
Next, we imagine transferring some water droplets from the full bottle
into the empty bottle, leaving behind some air bubbles, and ask ourselves
the same question. Now when we tilt the bottles there will be net transport
of water: the water droplets will roll downhill in one bottle and the air bubbles will move uphill in the other. Similarly, a few electrons in an otherwise
empty conduction band move opposite to an electric field, while holes in an
otherwise filled valence band move in the direction of the field. The bubble
analogy is imperfect, but it may provide a physical feel for why the charge
and mass of a hole have opposite signs from those of an electron.
In all the following discussions we shall concentrate on the electrons in
the conduction band and on the holes in the valence band. We can account
for the current flow in a semiconductor by the motion of these two typesEnergy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 97
of charge carriers. We draw valence and conduction bands on an electron
energy scale E, as in Fig. 3–8. However, we should remember that in the
valence band, hole energy increases oppositely to electron energy, because
the two carriers have opposite charge. Thus hole energy increases downward in Fig. 3–8 and holes, seeking the lowest energy state available, are
generally found at the top of the valence band. In contrast, conduction band
electrons are found at the bottom of the conduction band.
It would be instructive to compare the (E, k) band diagrams with
the “simplified” band diagrams that are used for routine device analysis
(Fig. 3–9). As discussed in Examples 3–1 and 3–2, an (E, k) diagram is a
plot of the total electron energy (potential plus kinetic) as a function of the
crystal-direction–dependent electron wavevector (which is proportional to
the momentum and therefore the velocity) at some point in space. Hence,
the bottom of the conduction band corresponds to zero electron velocity
or kinetic energy, and simply gives us the potential energy at that point in
space. For holes, the top of the valence band corresponds to zero kinetic
energy. For simplified band diagrams, we plot the edges of the conduction
and valence bands (i.e., the potential energy) as a function of position in the
device. Energies higher in the band correspond to additional kinetic energy
of the electron. Also, the fact that the band edge corresponds to the electron
potential energy tells us that the variation of the band edge in space is related
to the electric field at different points in the semiconductor. We will show
this relationship explicitly in Section 4.4.2.

In Fig. 3–9, an electron at location A sees an electric field given by
the slope of the band edge (potential energy), and gains kinetic energy (at
the expense of potential energy) by moving to point B. Correspondingly,
in the (E, k) diagram, the electron starts at k = 0, but moves to a nonzero
wavevector kB. The electron then loses kinetic energy to heat by scattering
mechanisms (discussed in Section 3.4.3) and returns to the bottom of the
band at B. The slopes of the (E, x) band edges at different points in space
reflect the local electric fields at those points. Hence, if the electric field
between A and B were not constant, as shown in Fig. 3–9, the slope of the
band edge would also not be constant but vary at each point reflecting the
magnitude and direction of the local electric field. In practice, the electron
may lose its kinetic energy in stages by a series of scattering events, as shown
by the colored dashed lines.
ExaMplE 3–1 In a long semiconductor bar (EG = 2 eV), conduction band electrons
come in from the left in the positive x-direction with a kinetic energy
of 3 eV. They move from location A to B to C to D. Between A and B,
the electric field is zero; between locations B and C, there is a linearly
varying voltage increase of 4 V; between C and D, the field is again zero.
Assuming no scattering, sketch a simplified band diagram describing the
motion of these electrons. Assuming that these electrons can be described
as plane waves, with a free-electron mass, write down the wavefunction
of the electrons at D. Leave your result in terms of an arbitrary normalization constant. Draw a band diagram and give the wavefunction at D in
terms of the normalization constant.

3.2.2 Effective Mass
The electrons in a crystal are not completely free, but instead interact with
the periodic potential of the lattice. As a result, their “wave–particle” motion
cannot be expected to be the same as for electrons in free space. Thus, in
applying the usual equations of electrodynamics to charge carriers in a solid,
we must use altered values of particle mass. In doing so, we account for most
of the influences of the lattice, so that the electrons and holes can be treated as
“almost free” carriers in most computations. The calculation of effective mass
must take into account the shape of the energy bands in three-dimensional
k-space, taking appropriate averages over the various energy bands.

Although electrons in solids are not free, most energy bands are close
to parabolic at their minima (for conduction bands) or maxima (for
valence bands). We can also approximate effective mass near those band
extrema from the curvature of the band.
SOlutiOn
E
k100 Chapter 3
The effective mass of an electron in a band with a given (E, k) relationship is found in Example 3–2 to be
m* =
U2
d2E/dk2 (3–3)
Thus the curvature of the band determines the electron effective mass.
For example, in Fig. 3–6a it is clear that the electron effective mass in GaAs
is much smaller in the direct Г conduction band (strong curvature) than in
the L or X minima (weaker curvature, smaller value in the denominator of
the m* expression).
A particularly interesting feature of Figs. 3–5 and 3–6 is that the curvature of d2E>dk2 is positive at the conduction band minima, but is negative
at the valence band maxima. Thus, the electrons near the top of the valence
band have negative effective mass, according to Eq. (3–3). Valence band electrons with negative charge and negative mass move in an electric field in the
same direction as holes with positive charge and positive mass. As discussed
in Section 3.2.1, we can fully account for charge transport in the valence band
by considering hole motion.
For a band centered at k = 0 (such as the Г band in GaAs), the (E, k)
relationship near the minimum is usually parabolic:
E =
U2
2m*
k2 + E
c (3–4)
Comparing this relation to Eq. (3–3) indicates that the effective mass
m* is constant in a parabolic band. On the other hand, many conduction
bands have complex (E, k) relationships that depend on the direction of
electron transport with respect to the principal crystal directions. In this case,
the effective mass is a tensor quantity. However, we can use appropriate
averages over such bands in most calculations.
Figure 3–10a shows the band structures for Si and GaAs viewed along
two major directions. While the shape is parabolic near the band edges (as indicated in Figure 3–5 and Example 3–2), there are significant non-parabolicities
at higher energies. The energies are plotted along the high symmetry [111]
and [100] directions in the crystal. The k = 0 point is denoted as Г. When we
go along the [100] direction, we reach a valley near X, while we reach the L
valley along the [111] direction. (Since the energies are plotted along different
directions, the curves do not look symmetric.) The valence band maximum in
most semiconductors is at the Г point. It has three branches: the heavy hole
band with the smallest curvature, a light hole band with a larger curvature,
and a split-off band at a different energy. We notice that for GaAs the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum are both at k = 0;
therefore it is direct band gap. Silicon, on the other hand, has six equivalent
conduction minima at X along the six equivalent 81009 directions; therefore,
it is indirect.Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 101

structures shown in Fig. 3–10a is to consider a certain value of energy, and
determine all the k vectors in three dimensions for which we get this energy.
We find that for Si we have six cigar-shaped ellipsoidal equi-energy surfaces
near the conduction band minima along the six equivalent X-directions,
with a longitudinal effective mass, ml, along the major axis, and two transverse effective masses, mt, along the minor axes. For GaAs, the conduction
band is more or less spherical for low energies. On the other hand, we have
warped spherical surfaces in the valence band. The importance of these
surfaces will be clear in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.4.1 when we consider different
types of effective masses in semiconductors.
In any calculation involving the mass of the charge carriers, we must
use effective mass values for the particular material involved. In all subsequent discussions, the electron effective mass is denoted by m* n and the hole
effective mass by m* p. The n subscript indicates the electron as a negative
charge carrier, and the p subscript indicates the hole as a positive charge
carrier.102 Chapter 3
There is nothing mysterious about the concept of an “effective” mass,
m*
n, and about the fact that it is different in different semiconductors. Indeed,
the “true” mass of an electron, m, is the same in Si, Ge, or GaAs—it is the
same as for a free electron in vacuum. To understand why the effective mass
is different from the true mass, consider Newton’s second law, which states
that the time rate of change of momentum is the force.
dp/dt = d(mv)/dt = Force (3–5a)
An electron in a crystal experiences a total force Fint + Fext, where Fint
is the collection of internal periodic crystal forces, and Fext is the externally
applied force. It is inefficient to solve this complicated problem involving
the periodic crystal potential (which is obviously different in different semiconductors) every time we try to solve a semiconductor device problem. It
is better to solve the complicated problem of carrier motion in the periodic
crystal potential just once, and encapsulate that information in what is called
the band structure, (E, k), whose curvature gives us the effective mass, m * n.
The electron then responds to external forces with this new m * n. For carriers
near the parabolic band extrema where the effective mass is as described,
Newton’s law is then written as:
d(m* nv)>dt = Fext (3–5b)
This is clearly an enormous simplification compared to the more
detailed problem. Obviously, the periodic crystal forces depend on the details
of a specific semiconductor; therefore, the effective mass is different in different materials.
The velocity of the electron, v, is the group velocity of a quantum
mechanical electron wavepacket that we introduced in Section 1.5.
v = dv>dk = (1>U) dE>dk (3–5c)
If E(k) is given by a simple parabolic relation as in Eq. (3–4), we see that
v = Uk>mn* = p>mn*. But in general, the carrier velocity is proportional
to the slope of the band structure. So, for instance, if an electron is at the Si
conduction band minimum (Fig. 3–10a), its velocity is zero, even though Uk
is nonzero here. For simple parabolic E(k) as in Eq. (3–4),
Eq. (3–5b) can then also be written as Fext = d(Uk)>dt (3–5d)
Since, Fext is not the total force imposed on the electron, clearly Uk
cannot be the true momentum. It is called the crystal momentum or quasimomentum. Equations (3–5c) and (3–5d) are the fundamental equations
governing carrier motion in semiconductors, and are known as semi-classical
dynamics.
Once we determine the band curvature effective mass components
from the orientation-dependent (E, k), we have to combine them appropriately for different types of calculations. We shall see in Section 3.3.2 that
when we are interested in determining the numbers of carriers in the bands,Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 103
we have to use a “density-of-states” effective mass by taking the geometric
mean of the band curvature effective masses, and the number of equivalent
band extrema. On the other hand, we will find in Section 3.4.1 that in problems involving the motion of carriers, one must take the harmonic mean of
the band curvature effective masses to get the “conductivity” effective mass.
3.2.3 intrinsic Material
A perfect semiconductor crystal with no impurities or lattice defects is called
an intrinsic semiconductor. In such material there are no charge carriers
at 0 K, since the valence band is filled with electrons and the conduction
band is empty. At higher temperatures EHPs are generated as valence band
electrons are excited thermally across the band gap to the conduction band.
These EHPs are the only charge carriers in intrinsic material.
The generation of EHPs can be visualized in a qualitative way by considering the breaking of covalent bonds in the crystal lattice (Fig. 3–11).
If one of the Si valence electrons is broken away from its position in the
bonding structure such that it becomes free to move about in the lattice, a
conduction electron is created and a broken bond (hole) is left behind. The
energy required to break the bond is the band gap energy Eg. This model
helps in visualizing the physical mechanism of EHP creation, but the energy
band model is more productive for purposes of quantitative calculation. One
important difficulty in the “broken bond” model is that the free electron and
the hole seem deceptively localized in the lattice. Actually, the positions of
the free electron and the hole are spread out over several lattice spacings
and should be considered quantum mechanically by probability distributions
(see Section 2.4).
Since the electrons and holes are created in pairs, the conduction band
electron concentration n (electrons per cm3) is equal to the concentration of
holes in the valence band p (holes per cm3). Each of these intrinsic carrier
concentrations is commonly referred to as ni. Thus for intrinsic material
n = p = ni (3–6)
At a given temperature there is a certain concentration of EHPs ni.
Obviously, if a steady state carrier concentration is maintained, there must

Si crystal.104 Chapter 3
be recombination of EHPs at the same rate at which they are generated.
Recombination occurs when an electron in the conduction band makes a
transition (direct or indirect) to an empty state (hole) in the valence band,
thus annihilating the pair. If we denote the generation rate of EHPs as gi
(EHP/cm3@s) and the recombination rate as ri, equilibrium requires that
ri = gi (3–7a)
Each of these rates is temperature dependent. For example, gi(T)
increases when the temperature is raised, and a new carrier concentration
ni is established such that the higher recombination rate ri(T) just balances
generation. At any temperature, we can predict that the rate of recombination of electrons and holes ri is proportional to the equilibrium concentration
of electrons n0 and the concentration of holes p0:
ri = arn0 p0 = arn2 i = gi (3–7b)
The factor a
r is a constant of proportionality which depends on the particular mechanism by which recombination takes place. We shall discuss the
calculation of ni as a function of temperature in Section 3.3.3; recombination
processes will be discussed in Chapter 4.
3.2.4 Extrinsic Material
In addition to the intrinsic carriers generated thermally, it is possible to create carriers in semiconductors by purposely introducing impurities into the
crystal. This process, called doping, is the most common technique for varying
the conductivity of semiconductors. By doping, a crystal can be altered so
that it has a predominance of either electrons or holes. Thus there are two
types of doped semiconductors, n-type (mostly electrons) and p-type (mostly
holes). When a crystal is doped such that the equilibrium carrier concentrations n0 and p0 are different from the intrinsic carrier concentration ni, the
material is said to be extrinsic.
When impurities or lattice defects are introduced into an otherwise
perfect crystal, additional levels are created in the energy band structure,
usually within the band gap. For example, an impurity from column V of the
periodic table (P, As, and Sb) introduces an energy level very near the conduction band in Ge or Si. This level is filled with electrons at 0 K, and very
little thermal energy is required to excite these electrons to the conduction
band (Fig. 3–12a). Thus at about 50–100 K virtually all of the electrons in
the impurity level are “donated” to the conduction band. Such an impurity
level is called a donor level, and the column V impurities in Ge or Si are
called donor impurities. From Fig. 3–12a we note that the material doped
with donor impurities can have a considerable concentration of electrons in
the conduction band, even when the temperature is too low for the intrinsic
EHP concentration to be appreciable. Thus semiconductors doped with a
significant number of donor atoms will have n0 W (ni, p0) at room temperature. This is n-type material.Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 105
Atoms from column III (B, Al, Ga, and In) introduce impurity levels
in Ge or Si near the valence band. These levels are empty of electrons at
0 K (Fig. 3–12b). At low temperatures, enough thermal energy is available
to excite electrons from the valence band into the impurity level, leaving
behind holes in the valence band. Since this type of impurity level “accepts”
electrons from the valence band, it is called an acceptor level, and the column
III impurities are acceptor impurities in Ge and Si. As Fig. 3–12b indicates,
doping with acceptor impurities can create a semiconductor with a hole

concentration p0 much greater than the conduction band electron concentration n0 (this type is p-type material).
In the covalent bonding model, donor and acceptor atoms can be visualized as shown in Fig. 3–12c. An As atom (column V) in the Si lattice has
the four necessary valence electrons to complete the covalent bonds with the
neighboring Si atoms, plus one extra electron. This fifth electron does not fit
into the bonding structure of the lattice and is therefore loosely bound to
the As atom. A small amount of thermal energy enables this extra electron
to overcome its coulombic binding to the impurity atom and be donated to
the lattice as a whole. Thus it is free to participate in current conduction. This
process is a qualitative model of the excitation of electrons out of a donor
level and into the conduction band (Fig. 3–12a). Similarly, the column III
impurity B has only three valence electrons to contribute to the covalent
bonding (Fig. 3–12c), thereby leaving one bond incomplete. With a small
amount of thermal energy, this incomplete bond can be transferred to other
atoms as the bonding electrons exchange positions. Again, the idea of an
electron “hopping” from an adjacent bond into the incomplete bond at the
B site provides some physical insight into the behavior of an acceptor, but
the model of Fig. 3–12b is preferable for most discussions.
We can calculate rather simply the approximate energy required to
excite the fifth electron of a donor atom into the conduction band (the donor
binding energy). Let us assume for rough calculations that the As atom of
Fig. 3–12c has its four covalent bonding electrons rather tightly bound and
the fifth “extra” electron loosely bound to the atom. We can approximate
this situation by using the Bohr model results, considering the loosely bound
electron as ranging about the tightly bound “core” electrons in a hydrogenlike orbit. From Eq. (2–15) the magnitude of the ground-state energy (n = 1)
of such an electron is
E =
mq4
2K 2U2 (3–8)
The value of K must be modified from the free-space value 4pg0 used
in the hydrogen atom problem to
K = 4rg0gr (3–9)
where g
r is the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor material.
In addition, we must use the conductivity effective mass m* n typical of the
semiconductor, discussed in more detail in Section 3.4.1.
ExaMplE 3–3 It was mentioned in Section 3.2 that the covalent bonding model gives a
false impression of the localization of carriers. As an illustration, calculate
the radius of the electron orbit around the donor in Fig. 3–12c, assuming
a ground state hydrogen-like orbit in Si. Compare with the Si lattice constant. Use m*
n = 0.26 m0 for Si.
SOlutiOn From Eq. (2–10) with n = 1 and using gr = 11.8 for Si,Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 107
Generally, the column V donor levels lie approximately 0.01 eV below
the conduction band in Ge, and the column III acceptor levels lie about
0.01 eV above the valence band. In Si the usual donor and acceptor levels
lie about 0.03–0.06 eV from a band edge.
In III–V compounds, column VI impurities occupying column V sites
serve as donors. For example, S, Se, and Te are donors in GaAs, since they
substitute for As and provide an extra electron compared with the As atom.
Similarly, impurities from column II (Be, Zn, Cd) substitute for column III
atoms to form acceptors in the III–V compounds. A more ambiguous case
arises when a III–V material is doped with Si or Ge, from column IV. These
impurities are called amphoteric, meaning that Si or Ge can serve as donors
or acceptors depending on whether they reside on the column III or column V sublattice of the crystal. In GaAs it is common for Si impurities to
occupy Ga sites. Since the Si has an extra electron compared with the Ga
it replaces, it serves as a donor. However, an excess of As vacancies arising
during growth or processing of the GaAs can cause Si impurities to occupy
As sites, where they serve as acceptors.
The importance of doping will become obvious when we discuss electronic devices made from junctions between p-type and n-type semiconductor material. The extent to which doping controls the electronic properties of
semiconductors can be illustrated here by considering changes in the sample
resistance which occur with doping. In Si, for example, the intrinsic carrier
concentration ni is about 1010 cm - 3 at room temperature. If we dope Si with
1015 As atoms/cm3, the conduction electron concentration changes by five
orders of magnitude. The resistivity of Si changes from about 2 * 105 Ω@cm
to 5 Ω@cm with this doping.
When a semiconductor is doped n-type or p-type, one type of carrier dominates. In the example given above, the conduction band electrons outnumber the
holes in the valence band by many orders of magnitude. We refer to the small
number of holes in n-type material as minority carriers and the relatively large
number of conduction band electrons as majority carriers. Similarly, electrons
are the minority carriers in p-type material, and holes are the majority carriers.
3.2.5 Electrons and Holes in Quantum Wells
We have discussed single-valued (discrete) energy levels in the band gap
arising from doping, and a continuum of allowed states in the valence and
conduction bands. A third possibility is the formation of discrete levels for
electrons and holes as a result of quantum-mechanical confinement.

Figure 3–13
Energy band discontinuities for a thin layer of GaAs sandwiched between layers of wider band gap
AIGaAs. In this case, the GaAs region is so thin that quantum states are formed in the valence and
conduction bands. Electrons in the GaAs conduction band reside on “particle in a potential well” states
such as E1 shown here, rather than in the usual conduction band states. Holes in the quantum well
occupy similar discrete states, such as Eh.
One of the most useful applications of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
or organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy (OMVPE) growth of multilayer compound semiconductors, as described in Section 1.4, is the fact that a continuous single crystal can be grown in which adjacent layers have different band
gaps. For example, Fig. 3–13 shows the spatial variation in conduction and
valence bands for a multilayer structure in which a very thin layer of GaAs
is sandwiched between two layers of AlGaAs, which has a wider band gap
than the GaAs. We will discuss the details of such heterojunctions (junctions
between dissimilar materials) in Section 5.8. It is interesting to point out here,
however, that a consequence of confining electrons and holes in a very thin
layer is that these particles behave according to the particle in a potential
well problem in the confinement direction, with quantum states calculated
in Section 2.4.3. (The particles are actually free to move in the other two
directions, but we will ignore that for now. In Section 8.4.6, we discuss that
we form two-dimensional electron and hole gases in such quantum wells,
leading to formation of “subbands,” rather than discrete quantum states as
discussed here.) Therefore, instead of having the continuum of states normally available in the conduction band, the conduction band electrons in the
narrow-gap material are confined to discrete quantum states as described by
Eq. (2–33), modified for effective mass and finite barrier height. Similarly,
the states in the valence band available for holes are restricted to discrete
levels in the quantum well. This is one of the clearest demonstrations of theEnergy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 109
3Examples of other types of statistics are Maxwell–Boltzmann for classical particles (e.g., gas) and Bose–
Einstein for photons. For two discrete energy levels, E2 and E1 (with E2 7 E1), classical gas atoms follow
a Boltzmann distribution; the number of atoms n2 in state E2 is related to the number n1 in E1 at thermal
equilibrium by

assuming the two levels have N2 and N1 number of states, respectively. The exponential term exp(–∆E>kT)
is commonly called the Boltzmann factor. It appears also in the denominator of the Fermi–Dirac distribution
function. We shall return to the Boltzmann distribution in Chapter 8 in discussions of the properties of lasers.
quantum mechanical results discussed in Chapter 2. From a practical device
point of view, the formation of discrete quantum states in the GaAs layer of
Fig. 3–13 changes the energy at which photons can be emitted. An electron
on one of the discrete conduction band states (E1 in Fig. 3–13) can make a
transition to an empty discrete valence band state in the GaAs quantum well
(such as Eh), giving off a photon of energy Eg + E1 + Eh, greater than the
GaAs band gap. Semiconductor lasers have been made in which such a quantum well is used to raise the energy of the transition from the infrared, typical
of GaAs, to the red portion of the spectrum. We will see other examples of
quantum wells in semiconductor devices in later chapters.
In calculating semiconductor electrical properties and analyzing device behavior, it is often necessary to know the number of charge carriers per cm3 in the
material. The majority carrier concentration is usually obvious in heavily doped
material, since one majority carrier is obtained for each impurity atom (for the
standard doping impurities). The concentration of minority carriers is not obvious, however, nor is the temperature dependence of the carrier concentrations.
To obtain equations for the carrier concentrations we must investigate the distribution of carriers over the available energy states. This type
of distribution is not difficult to calculate, but the derivation requires some
background in statistical methods. Since we are primarily concerned here
with the application of these results to semiconductor materials and devices,
we shall accept the distribution function as given.
3.3.1 the Fermi level
Electrons in solids obey Fermi–Dirac statistics.3 In the development of this
type of statistics, one must consider the indistinguishability of the electrons,
their wave nature, and the Pauli exclusion principle. The rather simple result
of these statistical arguments is that the distribution of electrons over a range
of allowed energy levels at thermal equilibrium is
f(E) = 1
1 + e(E - EF)>kT (3–10)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant (k = 8.62 * 10-5 eV/K = 1.38 * 10 - 23 J/K).
The function f(E), the Fermi–Dirac distribution function, gives the probability
3.3
CarriEr
COnCEntratiOnS110 Chapter 3
that an available energy state at E will be occupied by an electron at absolute
temperature T. The quantity EF is called the Fermi level, and it represents
an important quantity in the analysis of semiconductor behavior. We notice
that, for an energy E equal to the Fermi level energy EF, the occupation
probability is
f(EF) = [1 + e(EF - EF)/kT]-1 = 1
1 + 1 =
1 2
(3–11)
Thus an energy state at the Fermi level has a probability of 1/2 of being
occupied by an electron.
A closer examination of f(E) indicates that at 0 K the distribution takes
the simple rectangular form shown in Fig. 3–14. With T = 0 in the denominator of the exponent, f(E) is 1/(1 + 0) = 1 when the exponent is negative
(E 6 EF), and is 1/(1 + ∞) = 0 when the exponent is positive (E 7 EF).
This rectangular distribution implies that at 0 K every available energy state
up to EF is filled with electrons, and all states above EF are empty.
At temperatures higher than 0 K, some probability exists for states
above the Fermi level to be filled. For example, at T = T1 in Fig. 3–14 there
is some probability f(E) that states above EF are filled, and there is a corresponding probability [1-f(E)] that states below EF are empty. The Fermi
function is symmetrical about EF for all temperatures; that is, the probability
f(EF + ∆E) that a state ∆E above EF is filled is the same as the probability
[1 - f(EF - ∆E)] that a state ∆E below EF is empty. The symmetry of the
distribution of empty and filled states about EF makes the Fermi level a
natural reference point in calculations of electron and hole concentrations
in semiconductors.
In applying the Fermi–Dirac distribution to semiconductors, we must
recall that f(E) is the probability of occupancy of an available state at E. Thus
if there is no available state at E (e.g., in the band gap of a semiconductor),
there is no possibility of finding an electron there. We can best visualize
the relation between f(E) and the band structure by turning the f(E) vs. E
diagram on its side so that the E scale corresponds to the energies of the

band diagram (Fig. 3–15). For intrinsic material we know that the concentration of holes in the valence band is equal to the concentration of electrons
in the conduction band. Therefore, the Fermi level EF must lie at the middle
of the band gap in intrinsic material.4 Since f(E) is symmetrical about EF,
the electron probability “tail” of f(E) extending into the conduction band
of Fig. 3–15a is symmetrical with the hole probability tail [1 - f(E)] in the
valence band. The distribution function has values within the band gap
between E
v and Ec, but there are no energy states available, and no electron
occupancy results from f(E) in this range.
The tails in f(E) are exaggerated in Fig. 3–15 for illustrative purposes.
Actually, the probability values at Ev and Ec are quite small for intrinsic material
at reasonable temperatures. For example, in Si at 300 K, ni = pi ≂ 1010 cm-3,
whereas the densities of available states at E
v and Ec are on the order of
1019 cm - 3. Thus the probability of occupancy f(E) for an individual state in
the conduction band and the hole probability [1 - f(E)] for a state in the
valence band are quite small. Because of the relatively large density of states
in each band, small changes in f(E) can result in significant changes in carrier
concentration.
In n-type material there is a high concentration of electrons in the
conduction band compared with the hole concentration in the valence band

(recall Fig. 3–12a). Thus in n-type material the distribution function f(E)
must lie above its intrinsic position on the energy scale (Fig. 3–15b). Since
f(E) retains its shape for a particular temperature, the larger concentration
of electrons at E
c in n-type material implies a correspondingly smaller hole
concentration at E
v. We notice that the value of f(E) for each energy level
in the conduction band (and therefore the total electron concentration n0)
increases as EF moves closer to Ec. Thus the energy difference (Ec - EF)
gives a measure of n; we shall express this relation mathematically in the
following section.
For p-type material the Fermi level lies near the valence band (Fig. 3–15c)
such that the [1 - f(E)] tail below Ev is larger than the f(E) tail above Ec.
The value of (EF - Ev) indicates how strongly p-type the material is.
It is usually inconvenient to draw f(E) vs. E on every energy band
diagram to indicate the electron and hole distributions. Therefore, it is common practice merely to indicate the position of EF in band diagrams. This
is sufficient information, since for a particular temperature the position of
EF implies the distributions in Fig. 3–15.
3.3.2 Electron and Hole Concentrations at Equilibrium
The Fermi distribution function can be used to calculate the concentrations
of electrons and holes in a semiconductor, if the densities of available states
in the valence and conduction bands are known. For example, the concentration of electrons in the conduction band is
n0 = LE ∞
c
f(E)N(E)dE (3–12)
where N(E)dE is the density of states (cm - 3) in the energy range dE. The
subscript 0 used with the electron and hole concentration symbols (n0, p0)
indicates equilibrium conditions. The number of electrons per unit volume
in the energy range dE is the product of the density of states and the probability of occupancy f(E). Thus the total electron concentration is the integral
over the entire conduction band, as in Eq. (3–12).5 The function N(E) can
be calculated by using quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle
(Appendix IV).
It is shown in Appendix IV that N(E) is proportional to E1>2, so the
density of states in the conduction band increases with electron energy. On
the other hand, the Fermi function becomes extremely small for large energies. The result is that the product f(E)N(E) decreases rapidly above Ec, and
very few electrons occupy energy states far above the conduction band edge.
Similarly, the probability of finding an empty state (hole) in the valence band
5The upper limit is actually improper in Eq. (3–12), since the conduction band does not extend to infinite
energy. This is unimportant in the calculation of n0, however, since f(E) becomes negligibly small for large
values of E. Most electrons occupy states near the bottom of the conduction band at equilibrium.Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 113
[1 - f(E)] decreases rapidly below Ev, and most holes occupy states near the
top of the valence band. This effect is demonstrated in Fig. 3–16, which shows
the density of available states, the Fermi function, and the resulting number
of electrons and holes occupying available energy states in the conduction
and valence bands at thermal equilibrium (i.e., with no excitations except
thermal energy). For holes, increasing energy points down in Fig. 3–16, since
the E scale refers to electron energy.
The result of the integration of Eq. (3–12) is the same as that obtained
if we represent all of the distributed electron states in the conduction band
by an effective density of states Nc located at the conduction band edge Ec.

Therefore, the conduction band electron concentration is simply the effective
density of states at Ec times the probability of occupancy at Ec6
n0 = Ncf(Ec) (3–13)
In this expression we assume the Fermi level EF lies at least several kT
below the conduction band. Then the exponential term is large compared
with unity, and the Fermi function f(Ec) can be simplified as
f(Ec) = 1
1 + e(Ec - EF)>kT ≃ e-(Ec - EF)>kT (3–14)
Since kT at room temperature is only 0.026 eV, this is generally a good
approximation. For this condition the concentration of electrons in the conduction band is
n0 = Nce-(Ec - EF)>kT (3–15)
The effective density of states Nc is shown in Appendix IV to be
Nc
= 2 a2rmh2* nkT b 3>2 (3–16a)
Since the quantities in Eq. (3–16a) are known, values of Nc can be
tabulated as a function of temperature. As Eq. (3–15) indicates, the electron
concentration increases as EF moves closer to the conduction band. This is
the result we would predict from Fig. 3–15b.
In Eq. (3–16a), m* n is the density-of-states effective mass for electrons.
To illustrate how it is obtained from the band curvature effective masses
mentioned in Section 3.2.2, let us consider the 6 equivalent conduction band
minima along the X-directions for Si. Looking at the cigar-shaped equienergy surfaces in Fig. 3–10b, we find that we have more than one band
curvature to deal with in calculating effective masses. There is a longitudinal
effective mass ml along the major axis of the ellipsoid, and the transverse
effective mass m
t along the two minor axes. Since we have (m* n)3>2 appearing
in the density-of-states expression Eq. (3–16a), by using dimensional equivalence and adding contributions from all 6 valleys, we get
(m* n)3>2 = 6(ml mt 2)1>2 (3–16b)
It can be seen that this is the geometric mean of the effective masses.
6The simple expression for n0 obtained in Eq. (3–13) is the direct result of integrating Eq. (3–12), as in
Appendix IV. Equations (3–15) and (3–19) properly include the effects of the conduction and valence
bands through the density-of-states terms.Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 115
By similar arguments, the concentration of holes in the valence band is
p0 = Nv[1 - f(Ev)] (3–17)
where N
v is the effective density of states in the valence band. The probability of finding an empty state at Ev is
1 - f(Ev) = 1 - 1
1 + e(Ev - EF)>kT ≃ e-(EF - Ev)>kT (3–18)
for EF larger than Ev by several kT. From these equations, the concentration
of holes in the valence band is
p0 = Nve-(EF - Ev)>kT (3–19)
The effective density of states in the valence band reduced to the band
edge is
Nv
= 2 a2rmh2* pkT b 3>2 (3–20)
As expected from Fig. 3–15c, Eq. (3–19) predicts that the hole concentration increases as EF moves closer to the valence band.
The electron and hole concentrations predicted by Eqs. (3–15) and
(3–19) are valid whether the material is intrinsic or doped, provided thermal
equilibrium is maintained. Thus for intrinsic material, EF lies at some intrinsic
level Ei near the middle of the band gap (Fig. 3–15a), and the intrinsic electron and hole concentrations are
ni = Nce-(Ec - Ei)>kT, pi = Nve-(Ei - Ev)>kT (3–21)
The product of n0 and p0 at equilibrium is a constant for a particular
material and temperature, even if the doping is varied:
n0p0 = (Nce-(Ec - EF)>kT)(Nve-(EF - Ev)>kT) = NcNve-(Ec - Ev)>kT

There are six equivalent X valleys in the conduction band.
m*
n = 62>3[0.98(0.19)2]1>3 m0 = 1.1 m0
Note: For GaAs, the conduction band equi-energy surfaces are spherical. So there is only one band curvature effective mass, and it is equal to
the density-of-states effective mass (= 0.067 m0).
SOlutiOn116 Chapter 3
The intrinsic electron and hole concentrations are equal (since the carriers
are created in pairs), ni = pi; thus the intrinsic concentration is
ni = 2NcNv e-Eg>2kT (3–23)
The constant product of electron and hole concentrations in Eq. (3–22)
can be written conveniently as
n0p0 = n2 i (3–24)
This is an important relation, and we shall use it extensively in later calculations. The intrinsic concentration for Si at room temperature is approximately ni = 1.5 * 1010 cm-3.
Comparing Eqs. (3–21) and (3–23), we note that the intrinsic level Ei
is the middle of the band gap (Ec - Ei = Eg>2), if the effective densities
of states N
c and Nv are equal. There is usually some difference in effective
mass for electrons and holes, however, and Nc and Nv are slightly different
as Eqs. (3–16) and (3–20) indicate. The intrinsic level Ei is displaced from the
middle of the band gap, more for GaAs than for Ge or Si.
Another convenient way of writing Eqs. (3–15) and (3–19) is
n0 = nie(EF - Ei)>kT (3–25a)
p0 = nie(Ei - EF)>kT (3–25b)
obtained by the application of Eq. (3–21). This form of the equations indicates directly that the electron concentrations is ni when EF is at the intrinsic
level Ei, and that n0 increases exponentially as the Fermi level moves away
from Ei toward the conduction band. Similarly, the hole concentration p0
varies from ni to larger values as EF moves from Ei toward the valence band.
Since these equations reveal the qualitative features of carrier concentration
so directly, they are particularly convenient to remember.

3.3.3 temperature dependence of Carrier Concentrations
The variation of carrier concentration with temperature is indicated by
Eq. (3–25). Initially, the variation of n0 and p0 with T seems relatively
straightforward in these relations. The problem is complicated, however, by
the fact that ni has a strong temperature dependence [Eq. (3–23)] and that EF
can also vary with temperature. Let us begin by examining the intrinsic carrier concentration. By combining Eqs. (3–23), (3–16a), and (3–20) we obtain
ni(T) = 2a2rhkT 2 b 3>2(m* nm* p)3>4 e-Eg>2kT (3–26)
The exponential temperature dependence dominates ni(T), and a plot
of ln ni vs. 103>T appears linear (Fig. 3–17).7 In this figure we neglect variations due to the T 3>2 dependence of the density-of-states function and the
fact that E
g varies somewhat with temperature.8 The value of ni at any temperature is a definite number for a given semiconductor, and is known for
most materials. Thus we can take ni as given in calculating n0 or p0 from
Eq. (3–25).9
With ni and T given, the unknowns in Eq. (3–25) are the carrier concentrations and the Fermi level position relative to Ei. One of these two quantities must be given if the other is to be found. If the carrier concentration
is held at a certain value, as in heavily doped extrinsic material, EF can be
obtained from Eq. (3–25). The temperature dependence of electron concentration in a doped semiconductor can be visualized as shown in Fig. 3–18. In
this example, Si is doped n-type with a donor concentration Nd of 1015 cm - 3.

7When plotting quantities such as carrier concentration, which involve a Boltzmann factor, it is common to
use an inverse temperature scale. This allows terms which are exponential in 1/T to appear linear in the
semi-logarithmic plot. When reading such graphs, remember that temperature increases from right to left.
8For Si the band gap Eg varies from about 1.11 eV at 300 K to about 1.16 eV at 0 K.
9Care must be taken to use consistent units in these calculations. For example, if an energy such as Eg is
expressed in electron volts (eV), it should be multiplied by q (1.6 * 10-19C) to convert to joules if k is
in J/K; alternatively, Eg can be kept in eV and the value of k in eV/K can be used. At 300 K we can use
kT = 0.0259 eV and E
g in eV.118 Chapter 3
the donor electrons are bound to the donor atoms. As the temperature is
raised, these electrons are donated to the conduction band, and at about
100 K (1000>T = 10) all the donor atoms are ionized. This temperature
range is called the ionization region. Once the donors are ionized, the conduction band electron concentration is n0 ≃ Nd = 1015 cm - 3, since one electron is obtained for each donor atom. When every available extrinsic electron
has been transferred to the conduction band, n0 is virtually constant with
temperature until the concentration of intrinsic carriers ni becomes comparable to the extrinsic concentration Nd. Finally, at higher temperatures ni is
much greater than Nd, and the intrinsic carriers dominate. In most devices
it is desirable to control the carrier concentration by doping rather than by
thermal EHP generation. Thus one usually dopes the material such that the
extrinsic range extends beyond the highest temperature at which the device
is to be used.

3.3.4 Compensation and Space Charge neutrality
When the concept of doping was introduced, we assumed the material contained either Nd donors or Na acceptors, so that the extrinsic majority carrier concentrations were n0 ≃ Nd or p0 ≃ Na, respectively, for the n-type
or p-type material. It often happens, however, that a semiconductor contains both donors and acceptors. For example, Fig. 3–19 illustrates a semiconductor for which both donors and acceptors are present, but Nd 7 Na.
The predominance of donors makes the material n-type, and the Fermi level
is therefore in the upper part of the band gap. Since EF is well above the
acceptor level Ea, this level is essentially filled with electrons. However, with
EF above Ei , we cannot expect a hole concentration in the valence band

commensurate with the acceptor concentration. In fact, the filling of the Ea
states occurs at the expense of the donated conduction band electrons. The
mechanism can be visualized as follows: Assume an acceptor state is filled
with a valence band electron as described in Fig. 3–12b, with a hole resulting
in the valence band. This hole is then filled by recombination with one of
the conduction band electrons. Extending this logic to all the acceptor atoms,
we expect the resultant concentration of electrons in the conduction band
to be Nd - Na instead of the total Nd. This process is called compensation.
By this process it is possible to begin with an n-type semiconductor and add
acceptors until Na = Nd and no donated electrons remain in the conduction
band. In such compensated material, n0 = ni = p0 and intrinsic conduction
is obtained. With further acceptor doping the semiconductor becomes p-type
with a hole concentration of essentially Na – Nd .
The exact relationship among the electron, hole, donor, and acceptor
concentrations can be obtained by considering the requirements for space
charge neutrality. If the material is to remain electrostatically neutral, the sum
of the positive charges (holes and ionized donor atoms) must balance the
sum of the negative charges (electrons and ionized acceptor atoms):
p0 + Nd+ = n0 + Na- (3–27)
Thus in Fig. 3–19 the net electron concentration in the conduction band is
n0 = p0 + (Nd+ - Na-) (3–28)
If the material is doped n-type (n0 W p0) and all the impurities are
ionized, we can approximate Eq. (3–28) by n0 ≃ Nd - Na.
Since the intrinsic semiconductor itself is electrostatically neutral and
the doping atoms we add are also neutral, the requirement of Eq. (3–27) must
be maintained at equilibrium. The electron and hole concentrations and the
Fermi level adjust such that Eqs. (3–27) and (3–25) are satisfied.

Knowledge of carrier concentrations in a solid is necessary for calculating
current flow in the presence of electric or magnetic fields. In addition to the
values of n and p, we must be able to take into account the collisions of the
charge carriers with the lattice and with the impurities. These processes will
affect the ease with which electrons and holes can flow through the crystal,
that is, their mobility within the solid. As should be expected, these collision
and scattering processes depend on temperature, which affects the thermal
motion of the lattice atoms and the velocity of the carriers.
3.4.1 Conductivity and Mobility
The charge carriers in a solid are in constant motion, even at thermal equilibrium. At room temperature, for example, the thermal motion of an individual
electron may be visualized as random scattering from lattice vibrations, impurities, other electrons, and defects (Fig. 3–20a). Since the scattering is random,Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 121
there is no net motion of the group of n electrons/cm3 over any period of
time. This is not true of an individual electron, of course. The probability of
the electron in Fig. 3–20a returning to its starting point after some time t is
negligibly small. However, if a large number of electrons is considered (e.g.,
1016 cm–3 in an n-type semiconductor), there will be no preferred direction
of motion for the group of electrons and no net current flow.
If an electric field ℰ
x is applied in the x-direction, each electron experiences a net force -qℰx from the field. This force may be insufficient to
alter appreciably the random path of an individual electron; the effect when
averaged over all the electrons, however, is a net motion of the group in the
-x-direction (Fig. 3–20b). If px is the x-component of the total momentum
of the group, the force of the field on the n electrons/cm3 is
- nqℰx =
dpx
dt ` field (3–29)
Initially, Eq. (3–29) seems to indicate a continuous acceleration of the
electrons in the -x-direction. This is not the case, however, because the net
acceleration of Eq. (3–29) is just balanced in steady state by the decelerations of the collision processes. Thus while the steady field ℰx does produce
a net momentum p-x, the net rate of change of momentum when collisions
are included must be zero in the case of steady state current flow.
To find the total rate of momentum change from collisions, we must investigate the collision probabilities more closely. If the collisions are truly random,
there will be a constant probability of collision at any time for each electron.
Let us consider a group of N0 electrons at time t = 0 and define N(t) as the
number of electrons that have not undergone a collision by time t. The rate of
decrease in N(t) at any time t is proportional to the number left unscattered at t,

where t -1 is a constant of proportionality.
The solution to Eq. (3–30) is an exponential function
N(t) = N0e-t>t (3–31)
and t represents the mean time between scattering events,10 called the mean
free time. The probability that any electron has a collision in the time interval dt is dt>t. Thus the differential change in px due to collisions in time dt is
dpx = -pxdt
t
(3–32)
The rate of change of px due to the decelerating effect of collisions is
dpx
dt ` collisions = -ptx (3–33)
The sum of acceleration and deceleration effects must be zero for
steady state. Taking the sum of Eqs. (3–29) and (3–33), we have

electrons. As expected for steady state, Eq. (3–35) indicates that the electrons

Actually, the individual electrons move in many directions by thermal
motion during a given time period, but Eq. (3–36) tells us the net drift of an
average electron in response to the electric field. The drift speed described
by Eq. (3–36) is usually much smaller than the random speed due to the
thermal motion vth.
The current density resulting from this net drift is just the number of
electrons crossing a unit area per unit time (n8vx9) multiplied by the charge
on the electron (–q):
10Equations (3–30) and (3–31) are typical of events dominated by random processes, and the forms
of these equations occur often in many branches of physics and engineering. For example, in the
radioactive decay of unstable nuclear isotopes, N0 nuclides decay exponentially with a mean lifetime t.
Other examples will be found in this text, including the absorption of light in a semiconductor and the
recombination of excess EHPs.Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 123

n is the conductivity effective mass for electrons, different from
the density-of-states effective mass mentioned in Eq. (3–16b). While we use
the density-of-states effective mass to count the number of carriers in bands,
we must use the conductivity effective mass for charge transport problems.
To illustrate how it is obtained from the band curvature effective masses
mentioned in Section 3.2.2, once again let us consider the six equivalent conduction band minima along the X-directions for Si, with the band curvature
longitudinal effective mass, ml, along the major axis of the ellipsoid, and the
transverse effective mass, mt, along the two minor axes (Fig. 3–10b). Since
we have 1>m* n in the mobility expression Eq. (3–40a), by using dimensional
equivalence, we can write the conductivity effective mass as the harmonic
mean of the band curvature effective masses.

Note: For GaAs, the conduction band equi-energy surfaces are
spherical. So there is only one band curvature effective mass. (The
density of states effective mass and the conductivity effective mass are
both 0.067 m0.)
The mobility defined in Eq. (3–40a) can be expressed as the average
particle drift velocity per unit electric field. Comparing Eqs. (3–36) and
(3–40a), we have
on = -
8vx9
ℰ
x
(3–41)
The unit of mobility is (cm/s)>(V/cm) = cm2/V@s, as Eq. (3–41) suggests. The minus sign in the definition results in a positive value of mobility,
since electrons drift opposite to the field.
The current density can be written in terms of mobility as
Jx
= qnonℰx (3–42)
This derivation has been based on the assumption that the current is carried primarily by electrons. For hole conduction we change
n to p, -q to +q, and on to op, where op = + 8vx9 >ℰx is the mobility for
holes. If both electrons and holes participate, we must modify Eq. (3–42) to
Jx
= q(non + pop)ℰx = sℰx (3–43)
Values of on and op are given for many of the common semiconductor
materials in Appendix III. According to Eq. (3–40), the parameters determining mobility are m* and mean free time t. Effective mass is a property of
the material’s band structure, as described by Eq. (3–3). Thus we expect m* n
to be small in the strongly curved Ґ minimum of the GaAs conduction band
(Fig. 3–6), with the result that on is very high. In a more gradually curved
band, a larger m* in the denominator of Eq. (3–40) leads to a smaller value
of mobility. It is reasonable to expect that lighter particles are more mobile
than heavier particles (which is satisfying, since the common-sense value
of effective mass is not always apparent). The other parameter determining mobility is the mean time between scattering events, t. In Section 3.4.3
we shall see that this is determined primarily by temperature and impurity
concentration in the semiconductor.Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 125
3.4.2 drift and resistance
Let us look more closely at the drift of electrons and holes. If the semiconductor bar of Fig. 3–21 contains both types of carrier, Eq. (3–43) gives the
conductivity of the material. The resistance of the bar is then
R =
rL
wt
=
L
wt
1 s
(3–44)
where r is the resistivity (Ω-cm). The physical mechanism of carrier drift
requires that the holes in the bar move as a group in the direction of the
electric field and that the electrons move as a group in the opposite direction.
Both the electron and the hole components of current are in the direction of
the field, since conventional current is positive in the direction of hole flow
and opposite to the direction of electron flow. The drift current described by
Eq. (3–43) is constant throughout the bar. A valid question arises, therefore,
concerning the nature of the electron and hole flow at the contacts and in the
external circuit. We should specify that the contacts to the bar of Fig. 3–21 are
ohmic, meaning that they are perfect sources and sinks of both carrier types
and have no special tendency to inject or collect either electrons or holes.
If we consider that current is carried around the external circuit by
electrons, there is no problem in visualizing electrons flowing into the bar at
one end and out at the other (always opposite to I). Thus for every electron
leaving the left end (x = 0) of the bar in Fig. 3–21, there is a corresponding electron entering at x = L, so that the electron concentration in the
bar remains constant at n. But what happens to the holes at the contacts?
As a hole reaches the ohmic contact at x = L, it recombines with an electron, which must be supplied through the external circuit. As this hole disappears, a corresponding hole must appear at x = 0 to maintain space charge

flowing into the external circuit.
3.4.3 Effects of temperature and doping on Mobility
The two basic types of scattering mechanisms that influence electron and
hole mobility are lattice scattering and impurity scattering. In lattice scattering
a carrier moving through the crystal is scattered by a vibration of the lattice,
resulting from the temperature.11 The frequency of such scattering events
increases as the temperature increases, since the thermal agitation of the lattice becomes greater. Therefore, we should expect the mobility to decrease
as the sample is heated (Fig. 3–22). On the other hand, scattering from crystal defects such as ionized impurities becomes the dominant mechanism at
low temperatures. Since the atoms of the cooler lattice are less agitated, lattice scattering is less important; however, the thermal motion of the carriers
is also slower. Since a slowly moving carrier is likely to be scattered more
strongly by an interaction with a charged ion than is a carrier with greater
momentum, impurity scattering events cause a decrease in mobility with
decreasing temperature. As Fig. 3–22 indicates, the approximate temperature
dependencies are T -3>2 for lattice scattering and T 3>2 for impurity scattering.
Since the scattering probability of Eq. (3–32) is inversely proportional to the
mean free time and therefore to mobility, the mobilities due to two or more
scattering mechanisms add inversely:

As a result, the mechanism causing the lowest mobility value dominates, as shown in Fig. 3–22.
As the concentration of impurities increases, the effects of impurity
scattering are felt at higher temperatures. For example, the electron mobility on of intrinsic silicon at 300 K is 1350 cm2>(V@s). With a donor doping
concentration of 1017 cm-3, however, on is 700 cm2>(V@s). Thus, the presence
of the 1017 ionized donors/cm3 introduces a significant amount of impurity
scattering. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 3–23, which shows the variation of
mobility with doping concentration at room temperature.

3.4.4 High­Field Effects
One assumption implied in the derivation of Eq. (3–39) was that Ohm’s law is
valid in the carrier drift processes. That is, it was assumed that the drift current is
proportional to the electric field and that the proportionality constant (s) is not
a function of field ℰ. This assumption is valid over a wide range of ℰ. However,
large electric fields (7 103 V/cm) can cause the drift velocity and therefore the
current J = -qnvd to exhibit a sublinear dependence on the electric field. This
dependence of s upon is an example of a hot carrier effect, which implies that
the carrier drift velocity vd is comparable to the thermal velocity vth.
In many cases an upper limit is reached for the carrier drift velocity
in a high field (Fig. 3–24). This limit occurs near the mean thermal velocity
(≃107 cm/s) and represents the point at which added energy imparted by
the field is transferred to the lattice rather than increasing the carrier velocity. The result of this scattering limited velocity is a fairly constant current at
high field. This behavior is typical of Si, Ge, and some other semiconductors.
However, there are other important effects in some materials; for example,
in Chapter 10 we shall discuss a decrease in electron velocity at high fields
for GaAs and certain other materials, which results in negative conductivity
and current instabilities in the sample. Another important high-field effect is
avalanche multiplication, which we shall discuss in Section 5.4.2.
3.4.5 the Hall Effect
If a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the direction in which holes
drift in a p-type bar, the path of the holes tends to be deflected (Fig. 3–25).
Using vector notation, the total force on a single hole due to the electric and
magnetic fields is

The Hall effect.130 Chapter 3
In the y-direction the force is
Fy
= q(ℰy - vxbz) (3–47)
The important result of Eq. (3–47) is that unless an electric field ey is
established along the width of the bar, each hole will experience a net force
(and therefore an acceleration) in the –y-direction due to the qvxbz product.
Therefore, to maintain a steady state flow of holes down the length of the
bar, the electric field ey must just balance the product vxbz:
e
y = vxbz (3–48)
so that the net force F
y is zero. Physically, this electric field is set up when the
magnetic field shifts the hole distribution slightly in the –y-direction. Once
the electric field e
y becomes as large as vxbz, no net lateral force is experienced by the holes as they drift along the bar. The establishment of the electric field e
y is known as the Hall effect, and the resulting voltage VAB = eyw
is called the Hall voltage. If we use the expression derived in Eq. (3–37) for
the drift velocity (using + q and p0 for holes), the field ey becomes
e
y =
Jx
qp0
b
z = RHJxbz, RH K 1
qp0
(3–49)
Thus the Hall field is proportional to the product of the current density
and the magnetic flux density. The proportionality constant RH = (qp0)-1 is
called the Hall coefficient. A measurement of the Hall voltage for a known
current and magnetic field yields a value for the hole concentration p0

Since all of the quantities in the right-hand side of Eq. (3–50) can be
measured, the Hall effect can be used to give quite accurate values for carrier concentration.
If a measurement of resistance R is made, the sample resistivity r can
be calculated:
r(Ω - cm) = Rwt

Since the conductivity s = 1/r is given by qmpp0, the mobility is simply
the ratio of the Hall coefficient and the resistivity:

q(1>qRH) =

(3–52)
Measurements of the Hall coefficient and the resistivity over a range
of temperatures yield plots of majority carrier concentration and mobility
vs. temperature. Such measurements are extremely useful in the analysis ofEnergy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors 131
semiconductor materials. Although the discussion here has been related to
p-type material, similar results are obtained for n-type material. A negative
value of q is used for electrons, and the Hall voltage VAB and Hall coefficient
RH are negative. In fact, measurement of the sign of the Hall voltage is a common technique for determining if an unknown sample is p-type or n-type.
Referring to Fig. 3–25, consider a semiconductor bar with w = 0.1 mm, ExaMplE 3–8
t = 10 om, and L = 5 mm. For b = 10 kG in the direction shown
(1 kG = 10 - 5 Wb/cm2) and a current of 1 mA, we have VAB = -2 mV

In this chapter we have discussed homogeneous semiconductors, without
variations in doping and without junctions between dissimilar materials. In
the following chapters we will be considering cases in which nonuniform
doping occurs in a given semiconductor, or junctions occur between different
semiconductors or a semiconductor and a metal. These cases are crucial to
the various types of electronic and optoelectronic devices made in semiconductors. In anticipation of those discussions, an important concept should
be established here regarding the demands of equilibrium. That concept can
be summarized by noting that no discontinuity or gradient can arise in the
equilibrium Fermi level EF.
To demonstrate this assertion, let us consider two materials in intimate
contact such that electrons can move between the two (Fig. 3–26). These may
be, for example, dissimilar semiconductors, n- and p-type regions, a metal and
a semiconductor, or simply two adjacent regions of a nonuniformly doped
semiconductor. Each material is described by a Fermi–Dirac distribution
function and some distribution of available energy states that electrons can
occupy.

There is no current, and therefore no net charge transport, at thermal equilibrium. There is also no net transfer of energy. Therefore, for each
energy E in Fig. 3–26 any transfer of electrons from material 1 to material 2
must be exactly balanced by the opposite transfer of electrons from 2 to 1. We
will let the density of states at energy E in material 1 be called N1(E) and in
material 2 we will call it N2(E). At energy E the rate of transfer of electrons
from 1 to 2 is proportional to the number of filled states at E in material 1
times the number of empty states at E in material 2:
rate from 1 to 2 ∝ N1(E)f1(E) # N2(E)[1 - f2(E)] (3–53)
where f(E) is the probability of a state being filled at E in each material,
that is, the Fermi–Dirac distribution function given by Eq. (3–10). Similarly,
rate from 2 to 1 ∝ N2(E)f2(E) # N1(E)[1 - f1(E)] (3–54)
At equilibrium these must be equal:
N1(E)f1(E) # N2(E)[1 - f2(E)] = N2(E)f2(E) # N1(E)[1 - f1(E)] (3–55)
Rearranging terms, we have, at energy E,
N1f1N2 - N1f1N2f2 = N2f2N1 - N2f2N1f1 (3–56)
which results in
f1(E) = f2(E), that is, [1 + e(E - EF1)>kT]-1 = [1 + e(E - EF2)>kT]-1 (3–57)
Therefore, we conclude that EF1 = EF2. That is, there is no discontinuity
in the equilibrium Fermi level. More generally, we can state that the Fermi level
at equilibrium must be constant throughout materials in intimate contact. One
way of stating this is that no gradient exists in the Fermi level at equilibrium:
dEF
dx = 0 (3–58)
We will make considerable use of this result in the chapters to follow.

3.1 In a diamond lattice, each Si atom (with four valence electrons) is surrounded SuMMary
by four Si atoms that form four covalent bonds consisting of shared electron
pairs, thereby forming an octet of electrons in the valence shell. In zinc blende
structures such as GaAs, electrons are partly shared (covalent bonding) and
partly transferred from Ga to As (ionic bonding).
3.2 In crystals, electronic wavefunctions overlap to give various linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). Bonding or symmetric combinations of the
wavefunctions of valence-shell electrons form (almost) continuous allowed
bands of energies in the (almost) filled valence band, separated by an energy
gap from higher energy states in an (almost) empty conduction band that correspond to the antibonding or antisymmetric LCAOs. Empty electronic states
in the valence band can be considered to be positively charged carriers (holes),
while filled states in the conduction band are negatively charged (conduction)
electrons.
3.3 If the band gaps are large, we get insulators; if they are small (∼1 eV), we get
semiconductors; and if they are zero, we get conductors (metals).
3.4 Simplified band diagrams plot electron energy in the conduction band (increasing upward) as a function of position. The band edge corresponds to potential
energy, and the distance from the band edge gives the kinetic energy. Hole
energies increase downward in the valence band.
3.5 Carrier energies can also be plotted as a function of wavevector k (proportional
to velocity or momentum) to give (E, k) band structures, which can be direct
(conduction band minimum directly above valence band maximum) or indirect. The curvature of the (E, k) is inversely proportional to the effective mass
m* of the carriers. The m* accounts for the interactions of the carriers with the
periodic crystal potential.
3.6 In a pure semiconductor, we have an intrinsic concentration of electrons (or
holes), ni , that result from thermal generation–recombination between the
valence and conduction band (or bond breaking). If we replace some Si atoms
(with four valence electrons) with donor impurities with five valence electrons,
they donate conduction electrons, n (=Nd+); similarly, acceptors create holes p.
3.7 The number of electrons, n, is the integral with respect to energy from the bottom to the top of the conduction band of the product of the available density
of states (DOS) and the Fermi–Dirac (FD) distribution function. For parabolic
band structures, we get a parabolic DOS. The FD function is the average occupancy of an electronic state. The electron concentration n can also be expressed
as the product of an effective DOS at the band edge and the FD occupancy at
E
c, and similarly for holes p. The np product in equilibrium is constant (ni2).
3.8 Electrons in a solid execute random Brownian motion with an average kinetic
energy related to the thermal energy kT. In an electric field, electrons drift
(on top of the random motion) with a velocity equal to mobility times field
in the ohmic regime and saturation velocity at high fields. The drift current is
proportional to carrier concentration times drift velocity. Negatively charged
electrons drift opposite to the electric field, and the current is opposite to the134 Chapter 3
motion. Positively charged holes drift in the direction of the electric field, and
the current goes in the same direction as the hole flow.
3.9 Carrier mobility is determined by scattering, caused by deviations from a periodic lattice potential, such as lattice vibrations (phonons) or ionized impurities.
Carrier mobility and concentration can be obtained by the Hall effect and
resistivity measurements.

occupied is the same as the probability that the state ΔE below EF is empty.

3.5 At room temperature, an intrinsic AlAs has 4X minima along <100> directions,
and the following data are available: Electronics mass for Γ valley and X valley are 0.15 m0 and 0.76 m0. The hole mass is 0.76 m0. At what temperature the
number of electrons in the Γ minima and X minima will be equal if the energy
separation between them is 0.40 eV? The band gap for AlAs is 2.23 eV.
3.6 Since the effective mass of electrons in a conduction band decreases with
increasing curvature of the band according to Eq. (3–3), comment on the
electron effective mass in the Γ valley of GaAs compared with the indirect
X or L valleys. (See Fig. 3–10.) How is this effective mass difference reflected
in the electron mobility for GaAs and GaP shown in Appendix III? From
Fig. 3–10, what would you expect to happen to the conductivity of GaAs if Γ

Excess Carriers in Semiconductors
Most semiconductor devices operate by the creation of charge carriers
in excess of the thermal equilibrium values. These excess carriers can be
created by optical1 excitation or electron bombardment, or as we shall
see in Chapter 5, they can be injected across a forward-biased p-n junction. However the excess carriers arise, they can dominate the conduction
processes in the semiconductor material. In this chapter we shall investigate
the creation of excess carriers by optical absorption and the resulting properties of photoluminescence and photoconductivity. We shall study more
closely the mechanism of electron–hole pair recombination and the effects of
carrier trapping. Finally, we shall discuss the diffusion of excess carriers due
to a carrier gradient, which serves as a basic mechanism of current conduction along with the mechanism of drift in an electric field.

An important technique for measuring the band gap energy of a semiconductor is the absorption of incident photons by the material. In this experiment
photons of selected wavelengths are directed at the sample, and relative
transmission of the various photons is observed. Since photons with energies
greater than the band gap energy are absorbed while photons with energies

1In this context the word “optical” does not necessarily imply that the photons absorbed are in the visible
part of the spectrum. Many semiconductors absorb photons in the infrared region, but this is included in
the term “optical absorption.”Excess Carriers in Semiconductors 143
less than the band gap are transmitted, this experiment gives an accurate
measure of the band gap energy.
It is apparent that a photon with energy hn Ú Eg can be absorbed in
a semiconductor (Fig. 4–1). Since the valence band contains many electrons
and the conduction band has many empty states into which the electrons
may be excited, the probability of photon absorption is high. As Fig. 4–1 indicates, an electron excited to the conduction band by optical absorption may
initially have more energy than is common for conduction band electrons
(almost all electrons are near Ec unless the sample is very heavily doped).
Thus the excited electron loses energy to the lattice in scattering events until
its velocity reaches the thermal equilibrium velocity of other conduction band
electrons. The electron and hole created by this absorption process are excess
carriers; since they are out of balance with their environment, they must eventually recombine. While the excess carriers exist in their respective bands,
however, they are free to contribute to the conductivity of the material.
A photon with energy less than Eg is unable to excite an electron from
the valence band to the conduction band. Thus in a pure semiconductor,
there is negligible absorption of photons with hn 6 Eg. This explains why
some materials are transparent in certain wavelength ranges. We are able to
“see through” certain insulators, such as a good NaCl crystal, because a large
energy gap containing no electron states exists in the material. If the band
gap is about 2 eV wide, only long wavelengths (infrared) and the red part of
the visible spectrum are transmitted; on the other hand, a band gap of about
3 eV allows infrared and the entire visible spectrum to be transmitted.
If a beam of photons with hn 7 Eg falls on a semiconductor, there will
be some predictable amount of absorption, determined by the properties of
the material. We would expect the ratio of transmitted to incident light intensity to depend on the photon wavelength and the thickness of the sample. To
calculate this dependence, let us assume that a photon beam of intensity
I0 (photons>cm2@s) is directed at a sample of thickness l (Fig. 4–2). The beam
contains only photons of wavelength l, selected by a monochromator. As the
beam passes through the sample, its intensity at a distance x from the surface
can be calculated by considering the probability of absorption within any

increment dx. Since a photon which has survived to x without absorption has
no memory of how far it has traveled, its probability of absorption in any dx
is constant. Thus the degradation of the intensity, dI(x)>dx, is proportional
to the intensity remaining at x:
-
dI(x)
dx = aI(x) (4–1)
The solution to this equation is
I(x) = I0e-ax (4–2)
and the intensity of light transmitted through the sample thickness l is
I
t = I0e-al (4–3)
The coefficient a is called the absorption coefficient and has units
of cm - 1. This coefficient will of course vary with the photon wavelength
and with the material. In a typical plot of a vs. wavelength (Fig. 4–3), there
is negligible absorption at long wavelengths (hn small) and considerable
absorption of photons with energies larger than Eg. According to Eq. (2–2),
the relation between photon energy and wavelength is E = hc>l. If E is
given in electron volts and l in micrometers, this becomes E = 1.24>l.
Figure 4–4 indicates the band gap energies of some of the common
semiconductors, relative to the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet portions of
the spectrum. We observe that GaAs, Si, Ge, and InSb lie outside the visible
region, in the infrared. Other semiconductors, such as GaP and CdS, have
band gaps wide enough to pass photons in the visible range. It is important
to note here that a semiconductor absorbs photons with energies equal to
the band gap, or larger. Thus Si absorbs not only band gap light (∼1 om) but
also shorter wavelengths, including those in the visible part of the spectrum.

processes as compared to the “hot” process of incandescence, which increases with temperature. In fact,
most luminescent processes become more efficient as the temperature is lowered.

When electron–hole pairs are generated in a semiconductor, or when carriers
are excited into higher impurity levels from which they fall to their equilibrium states, light can be given off by the material. Many of the semiconductors
are well suited for light emission, particularly the compound semiconductors with direct band gaps. The general property of light emission is called
luminescence.2 This overall category can be subdivided according to the
excitation mechanism: If carriers are excited by photon absorption, the
radiation resulting from the recombination of the excited carriers is called
photoluminescence; if the excited carriers are created by high-energy electron
bombardment of the material, the mechanism is called cathodoluminescence;
if the excitation occurs by the introduction of current into the sample, the
resulting luminescence is called electroluminescence. Other types of excitation
are possible, but these three are the most important for device applications.

luminESCEnCE146 Chapter 4
4.2.1 photoluminescence
The simplest example of light emission from a semiconductor occurs for
direct excitation and recombination of an electron–hole pair (EHP), as
depicted in Fig. 3–5a. If the recombination occurs directly rather than via a
defect level, band gap light is given off in the process. For steady state excitation, the recombination of EHPs occurs at the same rate as the generation,
and one photon is emitted for each photon absorbed. Direct recombination
is a fast process; the mean lifetime of the EHP is usually on the order of
10 - 8 s or less. Thus the emission of photons stops within approximately 10 - 8 s
after the excitation is turned off. Such fast luminescent processes are often
referred to as fluorescence. In some materials, however, emission continues
for periods up to seconds or minutes after the excitation is removed. These
slow processes are called phosphorescence, and the materials are called
phosphors. An example of a slow process is shown in Fig. 4–5. This material contains a defect level (perhaps due to an impurity) in the band gap
which has a strong tendency to temporarily capture (trap) electrons from
the conduction band. The events depicted in the figure are as follows: (a) An
incoming photon with hn1 7 Eg is absorbed, creating an EHP; (b) the excited
electron gives up energy to the lattice by scattering until it nears the bottom
of the conduction band; (c) the electron is trapped by the impurity level Et
and remains trapped until it can be thermally reexcited to the conduction
band (d); (e) finally direct recombination occurs as the electron falls to an
empty state in the valence band, giving off a photon (hn2) of approximately
the band gap energy. The delay time between excitation and recombination
can be relatively long if the probability of thermal reexcitation from the trap
(d) is small. Even longer delay times result if the electron is retrapped several
times before recombination. If the trapping probability is greater than the
probability of recombination, an electron may make several trips between
the trap and the conduction band before recombination finally occurs. In
such material the emission of phosphorescent light persists for a relatively
long time after the excitation is removed.

The color of light emitted by a phosphor such as ZnS depends primarily on the impurities present, since many radiative transitions involve impurity levels within the band gap. This selection of colors is particularly useful
in the fabrication of a color television screen.
One of the most common examples of photoluminescence is the fluorescent lamp. Typically such a lamp is composed of a glass tube filled with
gas (e.g., a mixture of argon and mercury), with a fluorescent coating on
the inside of the tube. When an electric discharge is induced between electrodes in the tube, the excited atoms of the gas emit photons, largely in the
visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. This light is absorbed by the
luminescent coating, and the visible photons are emitted. The efficiency of
such a lamp is considerably better than that of an incandescent bulb, and the
wavelength mixture in light given off can be adjusted by proper selection of
the fluorescent material.

4.2.2 Electroluminescence
There are many ways by which electrical energy can be used to generate
photon emission in a solid. In LEDs an electric current causes the injection
of minority carriers into regions of the crystal where they can recombine
with majority carriers, resulting in the emission of recombination radiation. This important effect (injection electroluminescence) will be discussed
in Chapter 8 in terms of p-n junction theory.
The first electroluminescent effect to be observed was the emission of
photons by certain phosphors in an alternating electric field (the Destriau
effect). In this device, a phosphor powder such as ZnS is held in a binder
material (often a plastic) of a high dielectric constant. When an a-c electric
field is applied, light is given off by the phosphor. Such cells can be useful as
lighting panels, although their efficiency has thus far been too low for most
applications and their reliability is poor.
Thus the absorbed power is
10 - 1 = 9 mW = 9 * 10-3 J/s
(b) The fraction of each photon energy unit which is converted to heat is
2 - 1.43
2
= 0.285
Thus the amount of energy converted to heat per second is
0.285 * 9 * 10-3 = 2.57 * 10-3 J/s
(c) Assuming one emitted photon for each photon absorbed (perfect
quantum efficiency), we have
9 * 10-3 J/s
1.6 * 10-19 J/eV * 2 eV/photon = 2.81 * 1016 photons/s
Alternative solution: Recombination radiation accounts for 9 - 2.57 =
6.43 mW at 1.43 eV/photon.
6.43 * 10-3
1.6 * 10-19 * 1.43 = 2.81 * 1016 photons/s
When excess electrons and holes are created in a semiconductor, there is
a corresponding increase in the conductivity of the sample as indicated by
Eq. (3–43). If the excess carriers arise from optical luminescence, the resulting increase in conductivity is called photoconductivity. This is an important

and phOtOCOnduCtivityExcess Carriers in Semiconductors 149
effect, with useful applications in the analysis of semiconductor materials
and in the operation of several types of devices. In this section we shall
examine the mechanisms by which excess electrons and holes recombine
and apply the recombination kinetics to the analysis of photoconductive
devices. However, the importance of recombination is not limited to cases
in which the excess carriers are created optically. In fact, virtually every
semiconductor device depends in some way on the recombination of excess
electrons and holes. Therefore, the concepts developed in this section will
be used extensively in the analyses of diodes, transistors, lasers, and other
devices in later chapters.
4.3.1 direct recombination of Electrons and holes
It was pointed out in Section 3.1.4 that electrons in the conduction band
of a semiconductor may make transitions to the valence band (i.e., recombine with holes in the valence band) either directly or indirectly. In direct
recombination, an excess population of electrons and holes decays by electrons falling from the conduction band to empty states (holes) in the valence
band. Energy lost by an electron in making the transition is given up as a
photon. Direct recombination occurs spontaneously; that is, the probability
that an electron and a hole will recombine is constant in time. As in the case
of carrier scattering, this constant probability leads us to expect an exponential solution for the decay of the excess carriers. In this case the rate of decay
of electrons at any time t is proportional to the number of electrons remaining at t and the number of holes, with some constant of proportionality for
recombination, ar. The net rate of change in the conduction band electron
concentration is the thermal generation rate arn2 i from Eq. (3–7) minus the
recombination rate
dn(t)
dt = arn2 i - arn(t)p(t) (4–4)
Let us assume the excess electron–hole population is created at t = 0,
for example by a short flash of light, and the initial excess electron and hole
concentrations Δn and Δp are equal.3 Then as the electrons and holes recombine in pairs, the instantaneous concentrations of excess carriers Δn(t) and
Δp(t) are also equal. Thus we can write the total concentrations of Eq. (4–4)
in terms of the equilibrium values n0 and p0 and the excess carrier concentrations dn(t) = dp(t). Using Eq. (3–24) we have
ddn(t)
dt = arn2 i - ar[n0 + dn(t)][p0 + dp(t)]
= -a
r[(n0 + p0)dn(t) + dn2(t)] (4–5)
3We will use dn(t) and dp(t) to mean instantaneous excess carrier concentrations, and Δn, Δp for their
values at t = 0. Later we will use similar symbolism for spatial distributions, such as dn(x) and Δn(x = 0).150 Chapter 4
This nonlinear equation would be difficult to solve in its present form. Fortunately, it can be simplified for the case of low-level injection. If the excess carrier concentrations are small, we can neglect the Δn2
term. Furthermore, if the material is extrinsic, we can usually neglect the term
representing the equilibrium minority carriers. For example, if the material
is p-type (p0 W n0), Eq. (4–5) becomes
ddn(t)
dt = -arp0dn(t) (4–6)
The solution to this equation is an exponential decay from the original excess
carrier concentration Δn:
dn(t) = ∆ne-ar p0 t = ∆ne-t>tn (4–7)
Excess electrons in a p-type semiconductor recombine with a decay
constant v
n = (arp0) - 1, called the recombination lifetime. Since the calculation is made in terms of the minority carriers, vn is often called the minority
carrier lifetime. The decay of excess holes in n-type material occurs with
v
p = (arn0) - 1. In the case of direct recombination, the excess majority carriers decay at exactly the same rate as the minority carriers.
There is a large percentage change in the minority carrier electron
concentration in Example 4–2 and a small percentage change in the majority hole concentration. Basically, the approximations of extrinsic material
and low-level injection allow us to represent n(t) in Eq. (4–4) by the excess
concentration @n(t) and p(t) by the equilibrium value p0. Figure 4-7 indicates
that this is a good approximation for the example. A more general expression
for the carrier lifetime is
v
n =
1
a
r(n0 + p0) (4–8)
This expression is valid for n- or p-type material if the injection level
is low.
ExamplE 4–2 A numerical example may be helpful in visualizing the approximations
made in the analysis of direct recombination. Let us assume a sample
of GaAs is doped with 1015 acceptors/cm3. The intrinsic carrier concentration of GaAs is approximately 106 cm - 3; thus the minority electron
concentration is n0 = ni 2>p0 = 10 - 3 cm - 3. Certainly the approximation
of p0 W n0 is valid in this case. Now if 1014 EHP/cm3 are created at t = 0,
we can calculate the decay of these carriers in time. The approximation of
dn V p0 is reasonable, as Fig. 4–7 indicates. This figure shows the decay
in time of the excess populations for a carrier recombination lifetime of
v
n = vp = 10 - 8 s.Excess Carriers in Semiconductors 151
4.3.2 indirect recombination; trapping
In column IV semiconductors and in certain compounds, the probability of
direct electron–hole recombination is very small (Appendix III). There is
some band gap light given off by materials such as Si and Ge during recombination, but this radiation is very weak and may be detected only by sensitive equipment. The vast majority of the recombination events in indirect
materials occur via recombination levels within the band gap, and the resulting energy loss by recombining electrons is usually given up to the lattice as
heat rather than by the emission of photons. Any impurity or lattice defect
can serve as a recombination center if it is capable of receiving a carrier of
one type and subsequently capturing the opposite type of carrier, thereby
annihilating the pair. For example, Fig. 4–8 illustrates a recombination level
E
r which is below EF at equilibrium and therefore is substantially filled with
electrons. When excess electrons and holes are created in this material, each
EHP recombines at E
r in two steps: (a) hole capture and (b) electron capture.

Since the recombination centers in Fig. 4–8 are filled at equilibrium,
the first event in the recombination process is hole capture. It is important
to note that this event is equivalent to an electron at Er falling to the valence
band, leaving behind an empty state in the recombination level. Thus in hole
capture, energy is given up as heat to the lattice. Similarly, energy is given
up when a conduction band electron subsequently falls to the empty state
in E
r. When both of these events have occurred, the recombination center is
back to its original state (filled with an electron), but an EHP is missing. Thus
one EHP recombination has taken place, and the center is ready to participate in another recombination event by capturing a hole.
The carrier lifetime resulting from indirect recombination is somewhat more complicated than is the case for direct recombination, since it is
necessary to account for unequal times required for capturing each type of
carrier. In particular, recombination is often delayed by the tendency for a
captured carrier to be thermally reexcited to its original band before capture of
the opposite type of carrier can occur (Section 4.2.1). For example, if electron
capture (b) does not follow immediately after hole capture (a) in Fig. 4–8, the
hole may be thermally reexcited to the valence band. Energy is required for
this process, which is equivalent to a valence band electron being raised to the
empty state in the recombination level. This process delays the recombination,
since the hole must be captured again before recombination can be completed.
When a carrier is trapped temporarily at a center and then is reexcited
without recombination taking place, the process is often called temporary
trapping. Although the nomenclature varies somewhat, it is common to refer
to an impurity or defect center as a trapping center (or simply trap) if, after
capture of one type of carrier, the most probable next event is reexcitation. If
the most probable next event is capture of the opposite type of carrier, the
center is predominately a recombination center. The recombination can be
slow or fast, depending on the average time the first carrier is held before
the second carrier is captured. In general, trapping levels located deep in
the band gap are slower in releasing trapped carriers than are the levels

located near one of the bands. This results from the fact that more energy
is required, for example, to reexcite a trapped electron from a center near
the middle of the gap to the conduction band than is required to reexcite an
electron from a level closer to the conduction band.
As an example of impurity levels in semiconductors, Fig. 4–94 shows
the energy level positions of various impurities in Si. In this diagram a superscript indicates whether the impurity is positive (donor) or negative (acceptor) when ionized. Some impurities introduce multiple levels in the band gap;
for example, Zn introduces a level (Zn -) located 0.31 eV above the valence
band and a second level (Zn=) near the middle of the gap. Each Zn impurity
atom is capable of accepting two electrons from the semiconductor, one in
the lower level and then one in the upper level.
The effects of recombination and trapping can be measured by a photoconductive decay experiment. As Fig. 4–7 shows, a population of excess electrons and holes disappears with a decay constant characteristic of the particular
recombination process. The conductivity of the sample during the decay is
s(t) = q[n(t)on + p(t)op] (4–9)
Therefore, the time dependence of the carrier concentrations can be monitored by recording the sample resistance as a function of time. A typical

experimental arrangement is shown schematically in Fig. 4–10. A source of
short pulses of light is required, along with an oscilloscope for displaying
the sample voltage as the resistance varies. Microsecond light pulses can be
obtained by periodically discharging a capacitor through a flash tube containing a gas such as xenon. For shorter pulses, special techniques such as the
use of a pulsed laser must be used.
4.3.3 Steady State Carrier Generation; Quasi­Fermi levels
In the previous discussion we emphasized the transient decay of an excess
EHP population. However, the various recombination mechanisms are also
important in a sample at thermal equilibrium or with a steady state EHP
generation–recombination (G–R) balance.5 For example, a semiconductor
at equilibrium experiences thermal generation of EHPs at a rate g(T) = gi
described by Eq. (3–7). This generation is balanced by the recombination rate
so that the equilibrium concentrations of carriers n0 and p0 are maintained:
g(T) = arn2 i = arn0 p0 (4–10)
This equilibrium rate balance can include generation from defect centers as
well as band-to-band generation.
If a steady light is shone on the sample, an optical generation rate gop
will be added to the thermal generation, and the carrier concentrations n and
p will increase to new steady state values. We can write the balance between
generation and recombination in terms of the equilibrium carrier concentrations and the departures from equilibrium fn and fp:
g(T) + gop = arnp = ar(n0 + dn)(p0 + dp) (4–11)
For steady state recombination and no trapping, ∆n = ∆p; thus
Eq. (4–11) becomes
g(T) + gop = arn0p0 + ar[(n0 + p0)dn + dn2] (4–12)

5The term equilibrium refers to a condition of no external excitation except for temperature, and no net
motion of charge (e.g., a sample at a constant temperature, in the dark, with no fields applied). Steady
state refers to a non­equilibrium condition in which all processes are constant and are balanced by
opposing processes (e.g., a sample with a constant current or a constant optical generation of EHPs just
balanced by recombination).Excess Carriers in Semiconductors 155
The term a
rn0p0 is just equal to the thermal generation rate g(T). Thus,
neglecting the @n2 term for low-level excitation, we can rewrite Eq. (4–12) as
gop = ar (n0 + p0)dn = dn
v
n
(4–13)
The excess carrier concentration can be written as
dn = dp = gopvn (4–14)
More general expressions are given in Eq. (4–16), which allow for the
case v
p ≠ vn, when trapping is present.
As a numerical example, let us assume that 1013 EHP/cm3 are created ExamplE 4–3
optically every microsecond in a Si sample with n0 = 1014 cm-3 and
v
n = vp = 2 os. The steady state excess electron (or hole) concentration
is then 2 * 1013 cm - 3 from Eq. (4–14). While the percentage change in the
majority electron concentration is small, the minority carrier concentration changes from
p0 = n2 i >n0 = (2.25 * 1020)>1014 = 2.25 * 106 cm-3 (equilibrium)
to
p = 2 * 1013 cm-3 (steady state)
Note that the equilibrium equation n0p0 = n2 i cannot be used with the
subscripts removed; that is, np ≠ n2 i when excess carriers are present.
The steady state electron concentration is
n = n0 + dn = 1.2 * 1014 = (1.5 * 1010)e(Fn - Ei)>0.0259
where kT ≃ 0.0259 eV at room temperature. Thus the electron quasiFermi level position Fn - Ei is found from
Fn
- Ei = 0.0259 ln(8 * 103) = 0.233 eV
and F
n lies 0.233 eV above the intrinsic level. By a similar calculation, the
hole quasi-Fermi level lies 0.186 eV below Ei (Fig. 4–11). In this example,
the equilibrium Fermi level is 0.0259 ln(6.67 * 103) = 0.228 eV above
the intrinsic level.

It is often desirable to refer to the steady state electron and hole concentrations in terms of Fermi levels, which can be included in band diagrams
for various devices.The Fermi level EF used in Eq. (3–25) is meaningful only
when no excess carriers are present. However, we can write expressions for
the steady state concentrations in the same form as the equilibrium expressions by defining separate quasi-Fermi levels Fn and Fp for electrons and
holes. The resulting carrier concentration equations
n = nie(Fn - Ei)>kT
p = nie(Ei - Fp)>kT (4–15)
can be considered as defining relations for the quasi-Fermi levels.6
The quasi-Fermi levels of Fig. 4–11 illustrate dramatically the deviation
from equilibrium caused by the optical excitation; the steady state Fn is only
slightly above the equilibrium EF, whereas Fp is greatly displaced below
EF. From the figure it is obvious that the excitation causes a large percentage
change in minority carrier hole concentration and a relatively small change
in the electron concentration.
In summary, the quasi-Fermi levels Fn and Fp are the steady state analogues of the equilibrium Fermi level EF. When excess carriers are present,
the deviations of F
n and Fp from EF indicate how far the electron and hole
populations are from the equilibrium values n0 and p0. A given concentration
of excess EHPs causes a large shift in the minority carrier quasi-Fermi level
compared with that for the majority carriers. The separation of the quasiFermi levels F
n - Fp is a direct measure of the deviation from equilibrium
(at equilibrium Fn = Fp = EF). The concept of quasi-Fermi levels is very
useful in visualizing minority and majority carrier concentrations in devices
where these quantities vary with position.
4.3.4 photoconductive devices
There are a number of applications for devices which change their resistance
when exposed to light. For example, such light detectors can be used in the
home to control automatic night lights which turn on at dusk and turn off
at dawn. They can also be used to measure illumination levels, as in exposure meters for cameras. Many systems include a light beam aimed at the
photoconductor, which signals the presence of an object between the source
and detector. Such systems are useful in moving-object counters, burglar
alarms, and many other applications. Detectors are used in optical signaling
systems in which information is transmitted by a light beam and is received
at a photoconductive cell.
Considerations in choosing a photoconductor for a given application
include the sensitive wavelength range, time response, and optical sensitivity of the material. In general, semiconductors are most sensitive to photons
6In some texts the quasi­Fermi level is called IMREF, which is Fermi spelled backward.Excess Carriers in Semiconductors 157
with energies equal to the band gap or slightly more energetic than band
gap. Less energetic photons are not absorbed, and photons with hn ⪢ Eg
are absorbed at the surface and contribute little to the bulk conductivity. Therefore, the table of band gaps (Appendix III) indicates the photon
energies to which most semiconductor photodetectors respond. For example,
CdS (Eg = 2.42 eV) is commonly used as a photoconductor in the visible
range, and narrow-gap materials such as Ge (0.67 eV) and InSb (0.18 eV)
are useful in the infrared portion of the spectrum. Some photoconductors
respond to excitations of carriers from impurity levels within the band gap
and therefore are sensitive to photons of less than band gap energy.
The optical sensitivity of a photoconductor can be evaluated by examining the steady state excess carrier concentrations generated by an optical
generation rate gop. If the mean time each carrier spends in its respective
band before capture is vn and vp, we have
dn = v
ngop and dp = vpgop (4–16)
and the photoconductivity change is
∆s = qgop(vnmn + vpmp) (4–17)
For simple recombination, vn and vp will be equal. If trapping is present,
however, one of the carriers may spend little time in its band before being
trapped. From Eq. (4–17) it is obvious that for maximum photoconductive
response, we want high mobilities and long lifetimes. Some semiconductors
are especially good candidates for photoconductive devices because of their
high mobility; for example, InSb has an electron mobility of about 105 cm2/V@s
and therefore is used as a sensitive infrared detector in many applications.
The time response of a photoconductive cell is limited by the recombination times, the degree of carrier trapping, and the time required for carriers
to drift through the device in an electric field. Often these properties can be
adjusted by proper choice of material and device geometry, but in some cases
improvements in response time are made at the expense of sensitivity. For
example, the drift time can be reduced by making the device short, but this
substantially reduces the responsive area of the device. In addition, it is often
desirable that the device have a large dark resistance, and for this reason,
shortening the length may not be practical. There is usually a compromise
between sensitivity, response time, dark resistance, and other requirements
in choosing a device for a particular application.
When excess carriers are created nonuniformly in a semiconductor, the electron and hole concentrations vary with position in the sample. Any such
spatial variation (gradient) in n and p calls for a net motion of the carriers
from regions of high carrier concentration to regions of low carrier concentration. This type of motion is called diffusion and represents an important charge transport process in semiconductors. The two basic processes
4.4
diFFuSiOn OF
CarriErS158 Chapter 4
of current conduction are diffusion due to a carrier gradient and drift in an
electric field.
4.4.1 diffusion processes
When a bottle of perfume is opened in one corner of a closed room, the scent
is soon detected throughout the room. If there is no convection or other net
motion of air, the scent spreads by diffusion. The diffusion is the natural result
of the random motion of the individual molecules. Consider, for example, a
volume of arbitrary shape with scented air molecules inside and unscented
molecules outside the volume. All the molecules undergo random thermal
motion and collisions with other molecules. Thus each molecule moves in
an arbitrary direction until it collides with another air molecule, after which
it moves in a new direction. If the motion is truly random, a molecule at the
edge of the volume has equal probabilities of moving into or out of the volume on its next step (assuming the curvature of the surface is negligible on
the molecular scale). Therefore, after a mean free time t, half the molecules
at the edge will have moved into the volume and half will have moved out of
the volume. The net effect is that the volume containing scented molecules
has increased. This process will continue until the molecules are uniformly
distributed in the room. Only then will a given volume gain as many molecules as it loses in a given time. In other words, net diffusion will continue
as long as gradients exist in the distribution of scented molecules.
Carriers in a semiconductor diffuse in a carrier gradient by random
thermal motion and scattering from the lattice and impurities. For example,
a pulse of excess electrons injected at x = 0 at time t = 0 will spread out in
time as shown in Fig. 4–12. Initially, the excess electrons are concentrated at

x = 0; as time passes, however, electrons diffuse to regions of low electron
concentration until finally n(x) is constant.
We can calculate the rate at which the electrons diffuse in a onedimensional problem by considering an arbitrary distribution n(x) such
as Fig. 4–13a. Since the mean free path l between collisions is a small incremental distance, we can divide x into segments l wide, with n(x) evaluated at
the center of each segment (Fig. 4–13b).
The electrons in segment (1) to the left of x0 in Fig. 4–13b have equal
chances of moving left or right, and in a mean free time t one-half of them
will move into segment (2). The same is true of electrons within one mean
free path of x0 to the right; one-half of these electrons will move through x0
from right to left in a mean free time. Therefore, the net number of electrons
passing x0 from left to right in one mean free time is 1 2(n1lA) - 1 2(n2lA), where
the area perpendicular to x is A. The rate of electron flow in the +x-direction
per unit area (the electron flux density hn) is given by
hn(x0) = l
2t
(n1 - n2) (4–18)
Since the mean free path l is a small differential length, the difference
in electron concentration (n1 - n2) can be written as
n1 - n2 =
n(x) - n(x + ∆x)
∆x l (4–19)
where x is taken at the center of segment (1) and ∆x = l. In the limit of small
∆x (i.e., small mean free path l between scattering collisions), Eq. (4–18) can
be written in terms of the carrier gradient dn(x)>dx:

The quantity l2>2t is called the electron diffusion coefficient7 Dn, with
units cm2/s. The minus sign in Eq. (4–20) arises from the definition of the
derivative; it simply indicates that the net motion of electrons due to diffusion is in the direction of decreasing electron concentration. This is the result
we expect, since net diffusion occurs from regions of high particle concentration to regions of low particle concentration. By identical arguments, we
can show that holes in a hole concentration gradient move with a diffusion
coefficient D
p. Thus

It is important to note that electrons and holes move together in a carrier gradient [Eqs. (4–21)], but the resulting currents are in opposite directions [Eqs. (4–22)] because of the opposite charge of electrons and holes.
4.4.2 diffusion and drift of Carriers; built­in Fields
If an electric field is present in addition to the carrier gradient, the current
densities will each have a drift component and a diffusion component

and the total current density is the sum of the contributions due to electrons
and holes:
J(x) = Jn(x) + Jp(x) (4–24)
7If motion in three dimensions were included, the diffusion would be smaller in the x-direction. Actually,
the diffusion coefficient should be calculated from the true energy distributions and scattering mechanisms.
Diffusion coefficients are usually determined experimentally for a particular material, as described in
Section 4.4.5.Excess Carriers in Semiconductors 161
We can best visualize the relation between the particle flow and the
current of Eqs. (4–23) by considering a diagram such as shown in Fig. 4–14.
In this figure an electric field is assumed to be in the x-direction, along with
carrier distributions n(x) and p(x) which decrease with increasing x. Thus
the derivatives in Eqs. (4–21) are negative, and diffusion takes place in the
+x-direction. The resulting electron and hole diffusion currents [Jn (diff.)
and J
p (diff.)] are in opposite directions, according to Eqs. (4–22). Holes drift
in the direction of the electric field [hp (drift)], whereas electrons drift in
the opposite direction because of their negative charge. The resulting drift
current is in the +x-direction in each case. Note that the drift and diffusion
components of the current are additive for holes when the field is in the
direction of decreasing hole concentration, whereas the two components
are subtractive for electrons under similar conditions. The total current may
be due primarily to the flow of electrons or holes, depending on the relative
concentrations and the relative magnitudes and directions of electric field
and carrier gradients.
An important result of Eqs. (4–23) is that minority carriers can contribute significantly to the current through diffusion. Since the drift terms
are proportional to carrier concentration, minority carriers seldom provide
much drift current. On the other hand, diffusion current is proportional to
the gradient of concentration. For example, in n-type material the minority
hole concentration p may be many orders of magnitude smaller than the
electron concentration n, but the gradient dp>dx may be significant. As a
result, minority carrier currents through diffusion can sometimes be as large
as majority carrier currents.
In discussing the motion of carriers in an electric field, we should indicate the influence of the field on the energies of electrons in the band diagrams. Assuming an electric field ℰ(x) in the x-direction, we can draw the
energy bands as in Fig. 4–15, to include the change in potential energy of
electrons in the field. Since electrons drift in a direction opposite to the
field, we expect the potential energy for electrons to increase in the direction of the field, as in Fig. 4–15. The electrostatic potential 풱(x) varies in
the opposite direction, since it is defined in terms of positive charges and is
therefore related to the electron potential energy E(x) displayed in the figure
by 풱(x) = E(x)>(-q).

From the definition of electric field,
ℰ(x) = -
d풱(x)
dx (4–25)
we can relate ℰ(x) to the electron potential energy in the band diagram by
choosing some reference in the band for the electrostatic potential. We are
interested only in the spatial variation 풱(x) for Eq. (4–25). Choosing Ei as
a convenient reference, we can relate the electric field to this reference by
ℰ(x) = -
d풱(x)
dx = -
d
dx c (-Eqi ) d = q1 dE dxi (4–26)
Therefore, the variation of band energies with ℰ(x) as drawn in Fig. 4–15
is correct. The direction of the slope in the bands relative to ℰ is simple
to remember: Since the diagram indicates electron energies, we know
the slope in the bands must be such that electrons drift “downhill” in the
field. Therefore, ℰ points “uphill” in the band diagram.
At equilibrium, no net current flows in a semiconductor. Thus any fluctuation which would begin a diffusion current also sets up an electric field
which redistributes carriers by drift. An examination of the requirements
for equilibrium indicates that the diffusion coefficient and mobility must be
related. Setting Eq. (4–23b) equal to zero for equilibrium, we have

The equilibrium Fermi level does not vary with x, and the derivative of
Ei is given by Eq. (4–26). Thus Eq. (4–28) reduces to
Do

q
(4–29)
This result is obtained for either carrier type. This important equation
is called the Einstein relation. It allows us to calculate either D or o from a
measurement of the other. Table 4-1 lists typical values of D and o for several semiconductors at room temperature. It is clear from these values that
D>o ≃ 0.026 V.
An important result of the balance of drift and diffusion at equilibrium
is that built-in fields accompany gradients in Ei [see Eq. (4–26)]. Such gradients in the bands at equilibrium (EF constant) can arise when the band gap
varies due to changes in alloy composition. More commonly, built-in fields
result from doping gradients. For example, a donor distribution Nd(x) causes
a gradient in n0(x), which must be balanced by a built-in electric field ℰ(x).
4.4.3 diffusion and recombination; the Continuity Equation
In the discussion of diffusion of excess carriers, we have thus far neglected
the important effects of recombination. These effects must be included in
a description of conduction processes, however, since recombination can
cause a variation in the carrier distribution. For example, consider a differential length ∆(x) of a semiconductor sample with area A in the yz-plane
(Fig. 4–16). The hole current density leaving the volume, Jp(x + ∆x), can
be larger or smaller than the current density entering, Jp(x), depending on
the generation and recombination of carriers taking place within the volume. The net increase in hole concentration per unit time, 0p>0t, is the difference between the hole flux per unit volume entering and leaving, minus the
recombination rate. We can convert hole current density to hole particle flux
density by dividing Jp by q. The current densities are already expressed per
unit area; thus dividing Jp(x)>q by ∆(x) gives the number of carriers per unit
volume entering ∆xA per unit time, and (1>q)Jp(x + ∆x)>∆x is the number
leaving per unit volume and time:

with recombination. For example, a pulse of electrons in a semiconductor
(Fig. 4–12) spreads out by diffusion and disappears by recombination. To
solve for the electron distribution in time, n(x, t), we would begin with the
diffusion equation, Eq. (4–33a).

4.4.4 Steady State Carrier injection; diffusion length
In many problems a steady state distribution of excess carriers is maintained,
such that the time derivatives in Eqs. (4–33) are zero. In the steady state case

where L
n K 2Dnvn is called the electron diffusion length and Lp is the diffusion length for holes. We no longer need partial derivatives, since the time
variation is zero for steady state.
The physical significance of the diffusion length can be understood
best by an example. Let us assume that excess holes are somehow injected
into a semi-infinite semiconductor bar at x = 0, and the steady state hole
injection maintains a constant excess hole concentration at the injection
point fp(x = 0) = ∆p. The injected holes diffuse along the bar, recombining
with a characteristic lifetime v
p. In steady state we expect the distribution of
excess holes to decay to zero for large values of x, because of the recombination (Fig. 4–17). For this problem we use the steady state diffusion equation
for holes, Eq. (4–34b). The solution to this equation has the form
fp(x) = C1e x>Lp + C2e-x>Lp (4–35)
We can evaluate C1 and C2 from the boundary conditions. Since recombination must reduce dp(x) to zero for large values of x, fp = 0 at x = ∞ and
therefore C1 = 0. Similarly, the condition fp = ∆p at x = 0 gives C2 = ∆p,
and the solution is
fp(x) = ∆pe-x>Lp (4–36)

The injected excess hole concentration dies out exponentially in x
due to recombination, and the diffusion length Lp represents the distance
at which the excess hole distribution is reduced to 1/e of its value at the
point of injection. We can show that Lp is the average distance a hole diffuses
before recombining. To calculate an average diffusion length, we must obtain
an expression for the probability that an injected hole recombines in a particular interval dx. The probability that a hole injected at x = 0 survives to x
without recombination is fp(x)> ∆p = exp(-x>Lp), the ratio of the steady
state concentrations at x and 0. On the other hand, the probability that a hole
at x will recombine in the subsequent interval dx is
fp(x) - fp(x + dx)
fp(x) =
-(dfp(x)>dx)dx
fp(x) =
1 L
p
dx (4–37)
Thus the total probability that a hole injected at x = 0 will recombine
in a given dx is the product of the two probabilities:
(e-x>Lp)aL1pdxb = L1p e-x>Lpdx (4–38)
Then, using the usual averaging techniques described by Eq. (2–21), the
average distance a hole diffuses before recombining is
8x9 = L0 ∞x e-Lx>pLp dx = Lp (4–39)
The steady state distribution of excess holes causes diffusion, and
therefore a hole current, in the direction of decreasing concentration. From
Eqs. (4–22b) and (4–36) we have

Since p(x) = p0 + dp(x), the space derivative involves only the excess
concentration. We notice that since fp(x) is proportional to its derivative for
an exponential distribution, the diffusion current at any x is just proportional
to the excess concentration fp at that position.
Although this example seems rather restricted, its usefulness will
become apparent in Chapter 5 in the discussion of p-n junctions. The injection of minority carriers across a junction often leads to exponential distributions as in Eq. (4–36), with the resulting diffusion current of Eq. (4–40).

4.4.5 the haynes–Shockley Experiment
One of the classic semiconductor experiments is the demonstration of
drift and diffusion of minority carriers, first performed by J. R. Haynes
and W. Shockley in 1951 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The experiment
allows independent measurement of the minority carrier mobility m and
diffusion coefficient D. The basic principles of the Haynes–Shockley experiment are as follows: A pulse of holes is created in an n-type bar (for example)
that contains an electric field (Fig. 4–18); as the pulse drifts in the field and
spreads out by diffusion, the excess hole concentration is monitored at some
point down the bar; the time required for the holes to drift a given distance168 Chapter 4
in the field gives a measure of the mobility; the spreading of the pulse during
a given time is used to calculate the diffusion coefficient.
In Fig. 4–18 a pulse of excess carriers is created by a light flash at
some point x = 0 in an n-type semiconductor (n0 ⪢ p0). We assume that
the excess carriers have a negligible effect on the electron concentration
but change the hole concentration significantly. The excess holes drift in the
direction of the electric field and eventually reach the point x = L, where
they are monitored. By measuring the drift time td, we can calculate the drift
velocity vd and, therefore, the hole mobility:
vd =
L td
(4–41)
op =
vd
ℰ (4–42)
Thus the hole mobility can be calculated directly from a measurement of the
drift time for the pulse as it moves down the bar. In contrast with the Hall
effect (Section 3.4.5), which can be used with resistivity to obtain the majority carrier mobility, the Haynes–Shockley experiment is used to measure the
minority carrier mobility.
As the pulse drifts in the ℰ field it also spreads out by diffusion. By
measuring the spread in the pulse, we can calculate Dp. To predict the distribution of holes in the pulse as a function of time, let us first reexamine the
case of diffusion of a pulse without drift, neglecting recombination (Fig. 4–12).
The equation which the hole distribution must satisfy is the time-dependent
diffusion equation, Eq. (4–33b). For the case of negligible recombination
(vp long compared with the times involved in the diffusion), we can write the
diffusion equation as

The function which satisfies this equation is called a gaussian distribution,
fp(x, t) = c 22∆rPD
pt d e-x2>4Dpt (4–44)
where ∆P is the number of holes per unit area created over a negligibly small
distance at t = 0. The factor in brackets indicates that the peak value of the
pulse (at x = 0) decreases with time, and the exponential factor predicts the
spread of the pulse in the positive and negative x-directions (Fig. 4–19). If
we designate the peak value of the pulse as fp
9
at any time (say td), we can
use Eq. (4–44) to calculate Dp from the value of fp at some point x. The most
convenient choice is the point ∆x>2, at which fp is down by 1>e of its peak
value fp

. At this point we can write
e-1fp = fpe-(∆x>2)2>4Dptd (4–45)

Since ∆x cannot be measured directly, we use an experimental setup
such as Fig. 4–20, which allows us to display the pulse on an oscilloscope as
the carriers pass under a detector. As we shall see in Chapter 5, a forwardbiased p-n junction serves as an excellent injector of minority carriers,
and a reverse-biased junction serves as a detector. The measured quantity
in Fig. 4–20 is the pulse width ∆t displayed on the oscilloscope in time. It
is related to ∆x by the drift velocity, as the pulse drifts past the detector
point (2)

4.4.6 Gradients in the Quasi­Fermi levels
In Section 3.5 we saw that equilibrium implies no gradient in the Fermi level
EF. In contrast, any combination of drift and diffusion implies a gradient in
the steady state quasi-Fermi level.
ExamplE 4–5 An n-type Ge sample is used in the Haynes–Shockley experiment shown
in Fig. 4–20. The length of the sample is 1 cm, and the probes (1) and (2)
are separated by 0.95 cm. The battery voltage E0 is 2 V. A pulse arrives
at point (2) 0.25 ms after injection at (1); the width of the pulse ∆t is
117 ms. Calculate the hole mobility and diffusion coefficient, and check
the results against the Einstein relation.

We can use the results of Eqs. (4–23), (4–26), and (4–29) to demonstrate the power of the concept of quasi-Fermi levels in semiconductors [see
Eq. (4–15)]. If we take the general case of nonequilibrium electron concentration with drift and diffusion, we must write the total electron current as
Jn
(x) = qonn(x)ℰ(x) + qDn
dn(x)
dx (4–48)
where the gradient in electron concentration is
dn(x)
dx =
d
dx [nie(Fn - Ei)>kT] = nkT (x) adF dxn - dE dxi b (4–49)
Using the Einstein relation, the total electron current becomes
Jn
(x) = qonn(x)ℰ(x) + onn(x)c dF dxn - dE dxi d (4–50)
But Eq. (4–26) indicates that the subtractive term in the brackets is just
qℰ(x), giving a direct cancellation of qmnn(x)ℰ(x) and leaving
Jn
(x) = onn(x)
dF
n
dx (4–51)
Thus, the processes of electron drift and diffusion are summed up by
the spatial variation of the quasi-Fermi level. The same derivation can be
made for holes, and we can write the current due to drift and diffusion in the
form of a modified Ohm’s law
Jn
(x) = qonn(x)
d(Fn>q)
dx = un(x)
d(Fn>q)
dx (4–52a)
Jp
(x) = qopp(x)
d(Fp>q)
dx = up(x)
d(Fp>q)
dx (4–52b)
Therefore, any drift, diffusion, or combination of the two in a semiconductor results in currents proportional to the gradients of the two quasiFermi levels. Conversely, a lack of current implies constant quasi-Fermi
levels. One can use a hydrostatic analogy for quasi-Fermi levels and identify
it as water pressure in a system. Just as water flows from a high-pressure
region to a low-pressure region, until in equilibrium the water pressure is the
same everywhere, similarly electrons flow from a high- to low-electron quasiFermi level region, until we get a flat Fermi level in equilibrium. Quasi-Fermi
levels are sometimes also known as electrochemical potentials because, as
we just saw, the driving force for carriers is governed partly by gradients
of electrical potential (or electric field), which determines drift, and partly
by gradients of carrier concentration (which is related to a thermodynamic
concept called chemical potential), giving rise to diffusion.172 Chapter 4
4.1 Excess carriers, above the equilibrium values contributed by doping, may be
created optically (or by electrical biasing in devices). Generation–recombination
(G–R) of electron–hole pairs (EHPs) can occur by absorption of the photons with energy greater than the band gap, balanced by direct or indirect
recombination.
4.2 Generation–recombination processes can be mediated by traps, especially
deep traps near midgap. Band-to-band or trap-assisted G–R processes lead to
an average lifetime for the excess carriers. Carrier lifetime multiplied by the
optical generation rate establishes a steady state excess population of carriers. The square root of carrier lifetime multiplied by the diffusion coefficient
determines the diffusion length.
4.3 In equilibrium, we have a constant Fermi level. In nonequilibrium with excess
carriers, Fermi levels are generalized to separate quasi-Fermi levels for electrons and holes. The quasi-Fermi level splitting is a measure of the departure
from equilibrium. Minority carrier quasi-Fermi levels change more than majority carrier quasi-Fermi levels because the relative change of minority carriers
is larger. Gradients in the quasi-Fermi level determine the net drift–diffusion
current.
4.4 Diffusion flux measures the flow of carriers from high- to low-concentration
regions and is given by the diffusivity times the concentration gradient. The
direction of diffusion current is opposite to the flux for the negative electrons,
but in the same direction for the positive holes. Carrier diffusivity is related to
mobility by the thermal voltage kT>q (Einstein relation).
4.5 When carriers move in a semiconductor due to drift or diffusion, the timedependent carrier concentrations at different points is given by the carrier
continuity equation, which says that if more carriers flow into a point than flow
out, the concentration will increase as a function of time and vice versa. G–R
processes also affect carrier concentrations.
Summary

state would you expect for most Ga atoms in the sample? What would be the
predominant charge state of Zn? Au? Note: By charge state we mean neutral,
singly positive, doubly negative, etc.
4.2 On a Si sample, incident light is at t = 0 uniformly, which generates excess

4.6 A Si sample with 1015>cm3 donors is uniformly optically excited at room temperature such that 1019>cm3 EHPs are generated per second. Find the separation of the quasi-Fermi levels and the change of conductivity upon shining the
light. Electron and hole lifetimes are both 10 os. Dp = 12 cm2>s.
4.7 An n-type Si sample is doped at 1015 cm-3. We shine light on it to create EHPs
at 1019 cm-3>s. What is the steady state concentration of minority carriers, if
the lifetime is 100 ns? How long does it take for the hole concentration to drop
10%, after the light is switched off? How long for the hole concentration to
reach a value that is 10% higher than the thermal equilibrium value?
4.8 An n-type Si sample with Nd = 1015 cm - 3 is steadily illuminated such that
gop = 1021 EHP>cm3@s. If vn = vp = 1 ms for this excitation, calculate the separation in the quasi-Fermi levels, (Fn - Fp). Draw a band diagram such as Fig.4–11.
4.9 For a 2-cm-long doped Si bar (Nd = 1016cm - 3) with a cross-sectional
area = 0.05 cm2, what is the current if we apply 10 V across it? If we generate 1020 EHPs per second per cm3 uniformly in the bar and the lifetime

n = vp = 10 - 4s, what is the new current? Assume the low-level ar doesn’t
change for high-level injection. If the voltage is then increased to 100,000 V,
what is the new current? Assume op = 500 cm2>V@s, but you must choose the
appropriate value for electrons.
4.10 Design and sketch a photoconductor using a 5-mm-thick film of CdS, assuming
that v
n = vp = 10 - 6 s and Nd = 1014 cm - 3. The dark resistance (with gop = 0)
should be 10 MΩ, and the device must fit in a square 0.5 cm on a side; therefore, some sort of folded or zigzag pattern is in order. With an excitation of

4.12 A material is doped such that electron concentration varies linearly across the

4.13 For the steady state minority hole distribution shown in Fig. 4–17, find the
expression for the hole quasi-Fermi level position Ei - Fp(x) while p(x) ⪢ p0
(i.e., while Fp is below EF). On a band diagram, draw the variation of Fp(x). Be
careful—when the minority carriers are few (e.g., when Δp is ni), Fp still has a
long way to go to reach EF.
4.14 We inject electrons into a p-type semiconductor 5 microns long such that the
concentration varies linearly from 1020 cm-3 to 0 from left to right. If the mobility of the electrons is 500 cm2>V@s, what is the current density if the electric
fields are negligible?
4.15 We shine 1017 photons>cm2@s which are all absorbed near the surface x = 0
of a p-type semiconductor, raising the temperature of the sample to 500 K. If
the minority carrier lifetime is 200 ns in this material, electron mobility is
2000 cm2>V@s, and hole mobility is 500 cm2>V@s, calculate the electron diffusion current density 20 microns from the surface.
4.16 A long Si sample, n-doped at 1017 cm-3, with a cross-sectional area of
0.5 cm2 is optically excited by a laser such that 1020>cm3 EHPs are generated per second at x = 0 mm. They diffuse to the right. What is the total diffusion current at x = 50 mm? Electron and hole lifetimes are both 10 os.
op = 500 cm2>V@s; Dn = 36 cm2>s.
4.17 In an n-type semiconductor bar, there is an increase in electron concentration from left to right and an electric field pointing to the left. With a suitable
sketch, indicate the directions of the electron drift and diffusion current flow
and explain why. If we double the electron concentration everywhere, what
happens to the diffusion current and the drift current? If we add a constant
concentration of electrons everywhere, what happens to the drift and diffusion
currents? Explain your answers with appropriate equations.
4.18 The current required to feed the hole injection at x = 0 in Fig. 4–17 is obtained
by evaluating Eq. (4–40) at x = 0. The result is Ip(x = 0) = qADp∆p>Lp.
Show that this current can be calculated by integrating the charge stored in
the steady state hole distribution ∆p(x) and then dividing by the average hole
lifetime v
p. Explain why this approach gives Ip(x = 0).
4.19 The direction of the built-in electric field can be deduced without math by
sketching the result of a doping gradient on the band diagram. Starting with a
flat Fermi level at equilibrium, place Ei near or far from EF as the doping is varied for the two cases of a gradient in donor or acceptor doping as in Prob. 4.5.
Show the electric field direction in each case, based on Eq. (4–26). If a minority carrier is injected into the impurity gradient region, in what direction is it
accelerated in the two cases? This is an interesting effect that we will use later
in discussing bipolar transistors.
4.20 In Prob. 4.5, the direction of the built-in electric field due to a gradient in
doping was determined from Eqs. (4–23) and (4–26). In this problem, you
are asked to explain qualitatively why the field must arise and find its direction. (a) Sketch a donor doping distribution as in Prob. 4.5, and explain the fieldExcess Carriers in Semiconductors 175
required to keep the mobile electrons from diffusing down the gradient. Repeat
for acceptors and holes. (b) Sketch a microscopic region of the doping distribution, showing ionized donors and the resulting mobile electrons. Explain the
origin and direction of the field as the electrons attempt to diffuse toward lower
concentrations. Repeat for acceptors and holes.
4.21 A p-type Si sample is used in the Haynes-Shockley experiment. The length of
the sample is 2 cm, and two probes are separated by 1.8 cm. Voltage applied at
the two ends is 5 V. A pulse arrives at the collection point at 0.608 ms, and the
separation of the pulse is 180 sec. Calculate mobility and diffusion coefficient
for minority carriers. Verify it from the Einstein relation.
4.22 A semiconductor bar of length 2 mm with intrinsic carrier concentration of
1013 cm-3 is uniformly doped with donors at a concentration of 2 * 1013 cm-3 and
acceptors at a concentration of 1013 cm-3. If Dn = 26 cm2>s and Dp = 52 cm2>s,
calculate the electron and hole drift current densities for an applied voltage
of 5 V. In this semiconductor, electrons are in the ohmic regime for fields less
than 105 V>cm, but travel with a saturation velocity of 108 cm>s for fields above
that. For holes, they are ohmic below 104 V>cm, and travel with a saturation
velocity of 105 cm>s above that field. What are the electron and hole diffusion
current densities in the middle of the bar? (Assume T = 300 K.)
4.23 A recently discovered semiconductor has Nc = 1019 cm-3, Nv = 5 * 1018 cm-3,
and E
g = 2 eV. If it is doped with 1017 donors (fully ionized), calculate the electron, hole, and intrinsic carrier concentrations at 627°C. Sketch the simplified
band diagram, and specify the value of EF and Ei with respect to the band edges.
If we apply 5 V across a piece of this semiconductor 8 om long, what is the

Junctions
Most semiconductor devices contain at least one junction between p-type
and n-type material. These p-n junctions are fundamental to the performance
of functions such as rectification, amplification, switching, and other operations in electronic circuits. In this chapter we shall discuss the equilibrium
state of the junction and the flow of electrons and holes across a junction
under steady state and transient conditions. This is followed by a discussion
of metal–semiconductor junctions and heterojunctions between semiconductors having different band gaps. With the background provided in this chapter
on junction properties, we can then discuss specific devices in later chapters.

Although this book deals primarily with how devices work rather than how
they are made, it is instructive to have an overview of the fabrication process
in order to appreciate device physics. We have already discussed in Chapter 1
how single-crystal substrates and epitaxial layers needed for high-quality
devices are grown, and how the doping can be varied as a function of depth.
However, we have not discussed how doping can be varied laterally across
the surface, which is key to making integrated circuits on a wafer. Hence, it

179180 Chapter 5
is necessary to be able to form patterned masks on the wafer corresponding
to the circuitry, and introduce the dopants selectively through windows in
the mask. We will first briefly describe the major process steps that form the
underpinnings of modern integrated circuit manufacturing. Relatively few
unit process steps can be used in different permutations and combinations to
make everything from simple diodes to the most complex microprocessors.
5.1.1 thermal Oxidation
Many fabrication steps involve heating up the wafer in order to enhance a
chemical process. An important example of this is thermal oxidation of Si to
form SiO2. This involves placing a batch of wafers in a clean silica (quartz)
tube which can be heated to very high temperatures (~800-1000°C) using
heating coils in a furnace with ceramic brick insulating liners. An oxygencontaining gas such as dry O2 or H2O is flowed into the tube at atmospheric
pressure, and flowed out at the other end. Traditionally, horizontal furnaces
were used (Fig. 5–1a). More recently, it has become common to employ vertical furnaces (Fig. 5–1b). A batch of Si wafers is placed in the silica wafer
holders, each facing down to minimize particulate contamination. The wafers
are then moved into the furnace. The gases flow in from the top and flow out
at the bottom, providing more uniform flow than in conventional horizontal
furnaces. The overall reactions that occur during oxidation are:
Si + O2 S SiO2 (dry oxidation)
Si + 2H2O S SiO2 + 2H2 (wet oxidation)
In both cases, Si is consumed from the surface of the substrate. For
every micron of SiO2 grown, 0.44 mm of Si is consumed, leading to a 2.2*
volume expansion of the consumed layer upon oxidation. The oxidation
proceeds by having the oxidant (O2 or H2O) molecules diffuse through the

larger wafers, this

loading is often

already grown oxide to the Si–SiO2 interface, where the above reactions take
place. One of the very important reasons why Si integrated circuits exist (and
by extension why modern computers exist) is that a stable thermal oxide can
be grown on Si with excellent interface electrical properties. Other semiconductor materials do not have such a useful native oxide. We can argue that
modern electronics and computer technology owe their existence to this
simple oxidation process. Plots of oxide thickness as a function of time, at
different temperatures, are shown for dry and wet oxidation of (100) Si in
Appendix VI.
5.1.2 Diffusion
Another thermal process that was used extensively in IC fabrication in the
past is thermal in-diffusion of dopants in furnaces such as those shown in
Fig. 5–1a. The wafers are first oxidized and windows are opened in the oxide
using the photolithography and etching steps described in Sections 5.1.6
and 5.1.7, respectively. Dopants such as B, P, or As are introduced into these
patterned wafers in a high temperature (∼800-1100°C) diffusion furnace,
generally using a gas or vapor source. The dopants are gradually transported
from the high concentration region near the surface into the substrate
through diffusion, similar to that described for carriers in Section 4.4. The

maximum number of impurities that can be dissolved (the solid solubility) in
Si is shown for various impurities as a function of temperature in Appendix
VII. The diffusivity of dopants in solids, D, has a strong Arrhenius dependence on temperature, T. It is given by D = D0 exp-(EA>kT), where D0 is a
constant depending on the material and the dopant, and EA is the activation
energy. The average distance the dopants diffuse is related to the diffusion
length as in Section 4.4.4. In this case, the diffusion length is 2Dt, where t is
the processing time. The product Dt is sometimes called the thermal budget.
The Arrhenius dependence of diffusivity on temperature explains why high
temperatures are required for diffusion; otherwise, the diffusivities are far
too low. Since D varies exponentially with T, it is critical to have very precise
control over the furnace temperatures, within several degrees, in order to
have control over the diffusion profiles (Fig. 5–2). The dopants are effectively
blocked or masked by the oxide because their diffusivity in oxide is very low.
The diffusivities of various dopants in Si and SiO2 are shown as a function of
temperature in Appendix VIII. Difficulty with profile control and the very
high temperature requirement has led to diffusion being supplanted by ion
implantation as a doping technique, as discussed in Section 5.1.4.
The trend of using larger Si wafers has changed many processing steps.
For example, eight-inch and larger wafers are best handled in a vertical furnace (Fig. 5–1b) rather than the traditional horizontal furnace (Fig. 5–1a).
Also, large wafers are often handled individually for a variety of deposition,
etching, and implantation processes. Such single-wafer processing has led to
development of robotic systems for fast and accurate wafer handling.
The distribution of impurities in the sample at any time during the diffusion can be calculated from a solution of the diffusion equation with appropriate boundary conditions. If the source of dopant atoms at the surface
of the sample is limited (e.g., a given number of atoms deposited on the Si
surface before diffusion), a gaussian distribution as described by Eq. (4–44)

(for x 7 0) is obtained. On the other hand, if the dopant atoms are supplied continuously, such that the concentration at the surface is maintained
at a constant value, the distribution follows what is called a complementary
error function. In Fig. 5–2, there is some point in the sample at which the
introduced acceptor concentration just equals the background donor concentration in the originally n-type sample. This point is the location of the
p-n junction. To the left of this point in the sample of Fig. 5–2, acceptor atoms
predominate and the material is p-type, whereas to the right of the junction,
the background donor atoms predominate and the material is n-type. The
depth of the junction beneath the surface of the sample can be controlled by
the time and temperature of the diffusion (Prob. 5.2).
In the horizontal diffusion furnace shown in Fig. 5–1a, Si wafers are
placed in the tube during diffusion, and the impurity atoms are introduced
into the gas which flows through the silica tube. Common impurity source
materials for diffusions in Si are B2O3, BBr3, and BCl3 for boron; phosphorus
sources include PH3, P2O5, and POCl3. Solid sources are placed in the silica
tube upstream from the sample or in a separate heating zone of the furnace;
gaseous sources can be metered directly into the gas flow system; and with
liquid sources inert carrier gas is bubbled through the liquid before being introduced into the furnace tube. The Si wafers are held in a silica “boat” (Fig. 5–1a)
which can be pushed into position in the furnace and removed by a silica rod.
It is important to remember the degree of cleanliness required in these
processing steps. Since typical doping concentrations represent one part per
million or less, cleanliness and purity of materials are critically important.
Thus the impurity source and carrier gas must be extremely pure; the silica
tube, sample holder, and pushrod must be cleaned and etched in hydrofluoric
acid (HF) before use (once in use, the tube cleanliness can be maintained
if no unwanted impurities are introduced); finally, the Si wafers themselves
must undergo an elaborate cleaning procedure before diffusion, including
a final etch containing HF to remove any unwanted SiO2 from the surface.
5.1.3 rapid thermal Processing
Increasingly, many thermal steps formerly performed in furnaces are being
done using what is called rapid thermal processing (RTP). This includes
rapid thermal oxidation, annealing of ion implantation, and chemical vapor
deposition, which are discussed in the following paragraphs. A simple RTP
system is shown in Fig. 5–3. Instead of having a large batch of wafers in a conventional furnace where the temperature cannot be changed rapidly, a single
wafer is held (face down to minimize particulates) on low-thermal-mass
quartz pins, surrounded by a bank of high-intensity (tens of kW) tungsten–
halogen infrared lamps, with gold-plated reflectors around them. By turning on the lamps, the high-intensity infrared radiation shines through the
quartz chamber and is absorbed by the wafer, causing its temperature to rise
very rapidly (∼50-100°C>s). The processing temperature can be reached
quickly, after the gas flows have been stabilized in the chamber. At the end184 Chapter 5
of the process, the lamps are turned off, allowing the wafer temperature
to drop rapidly, once again because of the much lower thermal mass of
an RTP system compared to a furnace. In RTP, therefore, temperature is
essentially used as a “switch” to start or quench the reaction. Two critical
aspects of RTP are ensuring temperature uniformity across large wafers
and accurate temperature measurement, for example, with thermocouples
or pyrometers.
A key parameter in all thermal processing steps is the thermal budget, Dt. Generally speaking, we try to minimize this quantity because an
excessive Dt product leads to loss of control over compact doping profiles,
which is detrimental to ultra-small devices. In furnace processing, thermal
budgets are minimized by operating at as low a temperature as feasible so
that D is small. On the other hand, RTP operates at higher temperatures
(∼1000°C) but does so for only a few seconds (compared to minutes or
hours in a furnace).
5.1.4 ion implantation
A useful alternative to high-temperature diffusion is the direct implantation of energetic ions into the semiconductor. In this process a beam of
impurity ions is accelerated to kinetic energies ranging from several keV

to several MeV and is directed onto the surface of the semiconductor. As
the impurity atoms enter the crystal, they give up their energy to the lattice
in collisions and finally come to rest at some average penetration depth,
called the projected range. Depending on the impurity and its implantation energy, the range in a given semiconductor may vary from a few hundred angstroms to about 1 om. For most implantations the ions come to
rest distributed almost evenly about the projected range Rp, as shown in
Fig. 5–4. An implanted dose of h ions>cm2 is distributed approximately by

implantation energy. These parameters are shown as a function of energy

An ion implanter is shown schematically in Fig. 5–5. A gas containing the desired impurity is ionized within the source and is then extracted
into the acceleration tube. After acceleration to the desired kinetic energy,
the ions are passed through a mass separator to ensure that only the
desired ion species enters the drift tube.1 The ion beam is then focused and
scanned electrostatically over the surface of the wafer in the target chamber.
Repetitive scanning in a raster pattern provides exceptionally uniform doping of the wafer surface. The target chamber commonly includes automatic
wafer-handling facilities to speed up the process of implanting many wafers
per hour.
An obvious advantage of implantation is that it can be done at relatively low temperatures; this means that doping layers can be implanted
without disturbing previously diffused regions. The ions can be blocked by
metal or photoresist layers; therefore, the photolithographic techniques
described in Section 5.1.6 can be used to define ion-implanted doping patterns. Very shallow (tenths of a micron) and well-defined doping layers can
be achieved by this method. As we shall see in later chapters, many devices
require thin doping regions and may be improved by ion implantation techniques. Furthermore, it is possible to implant impurities which do not diffuse
conveniently into semiconductors.
One of the major advantages of implantation is the precise control of
doping concentration it provides. Since the ion beam current can be measured accurately during implantation, a precise quantity of impurity can be
introduced. This control over doping level, along with the uniformity of the
implant over the wafer surface, make ion implantation particularly attractive
for the fabrication of Si integrated circuits (Chapter 9).
One problem with this doping method is the lattice damage which
results from collisions between the ions and the lattice atoms. However,

most of this damage can be removed in Si by heating the crystal after the
implantation. This process is called annealing. Although Si can be heated to
temperatures in excess of 1000°C without difficulty, GaAs and some other
compounds tend to dissociate at high temperatures. For example, As evaporation from the surface of GaAs during annealing damages the sample.
Therefore, it is common to encapsulate the GaAs with a thin layer of silicon
nitride during the anneal. Another approach to annealing either Si or compounds is to heat the sample only briefly (e.g., 10 s) using RTP, rather than a
conventional furnace. Annealing leads to some unintended diffusion of the
implanted species. It is desirable to minimize this diffusion by optimizing
the annealing time and temperature. The profile after annealing is given by

5.1.5 chemical vapor Deposition (cvD)
At various stages of device fabrication, thin films of dielectrics, semiconductors and metals have to be formed on the wafer and then patterned and
etched. We have already discussed one important example of this involving thermal oxidation of Si. SiO2 films can also be formed by low pressure
(∼100 mTorr)2 chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) (Fig. 5–6) or plasmaenhanced CVD (PECVD). The key differences are that thermal oxidation
consumes Si from the substrate, and very high temperatures are required,
whereas CVD of SiO2 does not consume Si from the substrate and can be
done at much lower temperatures. The CVD process reacts a Si-containing
gas such as SiH4 with an oxygen-containing precursor, causing a chemical
reaction, leading to the deposition of SiO2 on the substrate. Being able to
deposit SiO2 is very important in certain applications. As a complicated

device structure is built up, the Si substrate may not be available for reaction, or there may be metallization on the wafer that cannot withstand very
high temperatures. In such cases, CVD is a necessary alternative.
Although we have used deposition of SiO2 as an important example,
LPCVD is also widely used to deposit other dielectrics such as silicon nitride
(Si3N4), and polycrystalline or amorphous Si. It should also be clear that the
VPE of Si or MOCVD of compound semiconductors discussed in Chapter 1
is really a special, more challenging example of CVD where not only must a
film be deposited, but single-crystal growth must also be maintained.
5.1.6 Photolithography
Patterns corresponding to complex circuitry are formed on a wafer using
photolithography. This involves first generating a reticle which is a transparent silica (quartz) plate containing the pattern (Fig. 5–7a). Opaque regions
on the mask are made up of an ultraviolet (UV) light-absorbing layer, such
as iron oxide. The reticle typically contains the patterns corresponding to
a single chip or die, rather than the entire wafer (in which case it would
be called a mask). It is usually created by a computer-controlled electron
beam driven by the circuit layout data, using pattern generation software. A
thin layer of electron beam sensitive material called electron beam resist is
placed on the iron-oxide–covered quartz plate, and the resist is exposed by
the electron beam. A resist is a thin organic polymer layer that undergoes
chemical changes if it is exposed to energetic particles such as electrons
or photons. The resist is exposed selectively, corresponding to the patterns
that are required. After exposure, the resist is developed in a chemical solution. There are two types of resist. The developer is used to remove either
the exposed (positive resist) or the unexposed (negative resist) material.
The iron oxide layer is then selectively etched off in a plasma to generate the
appropriate patterns. The reticle can be used repeatedly to pattern Si wafers.
To make a typical integrated circuit, a dozen or more reticles are required,
corresponding to different process steps.

The Si wafers are first covered with an UV light-sensitive organic material or photoemulsion called photoresist by dispensing the liquid resist onto
the wafer and spinning it rapidly (∼3000 rpm) to form a uniform coating
(∼0.5 om). As mentioned above, there are two types of resist—negative,
which forms the opposite polarity image on the wafer compared to that on the
reticle, and positive (same polarity). Currently, positive resist has supplanted
negative because it can achieve far better resolution, down to ∼0.25 om
using UV light. The light shines on the resist-covered wafer through the
reticle, causing the exposed regions to become acidified. Subsequently,
the exposed wafers are developed in a basic solution of NaOH, which causes
the exposed resist to etch away. Thereby, the pattern on the reticle is transferred to the die on the wafer. After the remaining resist is cured by baking at
∼125°C in order to harden it, the appropriate process step can be performed,
such as implanting dopants through windows in the resist pattern or plasma
etching of the underlying layers.
The exposure of the wafers is achieved die-by-die in a step-and-repeat
system called a stepper (Fig. 5–7b). As the name implies, the UV light shines
selectively through the reticle onto a single die location. After the photoexposure is done, the wafer mechanically translates on a precisely controlled
x-y translation stage to the next die location and is exposed again. It is very
important to be able to precisely align the patterns on the reticle with respect
to pre-existing patterns on the wafer, which is why these tools are also sometimes known as mask aligners. An advantage of such a “stepper” projection
system is that refocusing and realignment can be done at each die to accommodate slight variations in surface flatness across the wafer. This is especially
important in printing ultra-small linewidths over a very large wafer. The
success of modern IC manufacture has depended on numerous advances in
deep UV light sources, precision optical projection systems, techniques for
registration between masking layers, and stepper design.
What makes photolithography (along with etching) so critical is that it
obviously determines how small and closely packed the individual devices
(e.g., transistors) can be made. We shall see that smaller devices operate
better in terms of higher speed and lower power dissipation. What makes
modern lithography so challenging is the fact that pattern dimensions are
comparable to the wavelength of light that is used. Under these circumstances we cannot treat light propagation using simple geometrical ray
optics; rather, the wave nature of light is manifested in terms of diffraction,
which makes it harder to control the patterns. The diffraction-limited minimum geometry is given by
lmin = 0.8 l>NA (5–2a)
where l is the wavelength of the light and NA (∼0.5) is the numerical
aperture or “size” of the lens used in the aligner. This expression implies
that for finer patterns, we should work with larger (and, therefore, more
expensive) lenses and shorter wavelengths. As a result, smaller geometries190 Chapter 5
require shorter wavelengths. This has led the push to replace UV mercury
lamp sources (0.365 om), shown in Fig. 5–7b, with argon fluoride (ArF)
excimer lasers (l = 0.193 om). Novel exposure techniques employing
phase-shift masks, optical proximity correction, and off-axis illumination all
exploit Fourier optics to allow resolution near or below the dimension of the
wavelength being used. There is also interest in extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
sources (13 nm), which use a plasma to generate such short wavelengths,
for next-generation lithography. X-ray lithography involving even shorter
wavelengths has been the source of much research for many years, but does
not seem practical in a manufacturing environment. A promising advancement involves imprinting patterns in a photoresist using a physical pattern,
or mold, thereby overcoming the diffraction limits of optical lithography.

2(NA)2 (5–2b)
The DOF tells us the range of distances around the focal plane where the
image quality is sharp. Unfortunately, this expression implies that exposure with very short wavelengths leads to poor DOF. This is a big challenge
because the topography or the “hills and valleys” on a chip during processing
can be larger than the DOF allowed by the optics.
We must therefore add steps in the fabrication process to planarize the
surface using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). As the name implies,
the planarizing process is partly chemical in nature (using a basic solution),
and partly mechanical grinding of the layers using an abrasive slurry. As
described in Section 1.3.3, CMP can be achieved using a slurry of fine SiO2
particles in an NaOH solution.
The expression for diffraction-limited geometry [Eq. (5–2a)] explains
why there is interest in electron beam lithography. The de Broglie relation
states that the wavelength of a particle varies inversely with its momentum:
l =
hp
(5–2c)
Thus, more massive or energetic particles have shorter wavelengths.
Electron beams are easily generated, focused, and deflected. Since a 10-keV
electron has a wavelength of about 0.1 Å, the linewidth limits become the
size of the focused beam and its interaction with the photoresist layer. It is
possible to achieve linewidths of 0.1 mm by direct electron-beam writing on
the wafer photoresist. Furthermore, the computer-controlled electron-beam
exposure requires no masks. This capability allows extremely dense packing of circuit elements on the chip, but direct writing of complex patterns is
slow. Because of the time required for electron-beam wafer exposure, it is
usually advantageous to use electron-beam writing to make the reticle (Fig.
5–7a) and then to expose the wafer photoresist by using photons. Another
approach being considered is electron projection lithography (EPL), using
a mask, instead of steering a focused electron beam, in order to solve the
throughput problem.
5.1.7 etching
After the photoresist pattern is formed, it can be used as a mask to etch the
material underneath. In the early days of Si technology, etching was done
using wet chemicals. For example, dilute HF can be used to etch SiO2 layers
grown on a Si substrate with excellent selectivity. The term selectivity here
refers to the fact that HF attacks SiO2, but does not affect the Si substrate
underneath or the photoresist mask. Although many wet etches are selective,192 Chapter 5
they are unfortunately isotropic, which means that they etch as fast laterally
as they etch vertically. This is unacceptable for ultra-small features. Hence,
wet etching has been largely supplanted by dry, plasma-based etching which
can be made both selective and anisotropic (etches vertically but not laterally
along the surface). In modern IC processing the main use of wet chemical
processing is in cleaning the wafers.
Plasmas are ubiquitous in IC processing. The most popular type of
plasma-based etching is known as reactive ion etching (RIE) (Fig. 5–8). In a
typical process, appropriate etch gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
flow into the chamber at reduced pressure (∼1-100 mTorr), and a plasma
is struck by applying an rf voltage across a cathode and an anode. The rf
voltage accelerates the light electrons in the system to much higher kinetic
energies (∼10 eV) than the heavier ions. The high-energy electrons collide
with neutral atoms and molecules to create ions and molecular fragments
called radicals. The wafers are held on the rf powered cathode, while the
grounded chamber walls act as the anode. From a study of plasma physics,
we can show that although the bulk of the plasma is a highly conducting,
equi-potential region, less conducting sheath regions form next to the two
electrodes. It can also be shown that the sheath voltage next to the cathode
can be increased by making the (powered) cathode smaller in area than the
(grounded) anode. A high d-c voltage (∼100-1000 V) develops across the
sheath next to the rf powered cathode, such that positive ions gain kinetic
energy by being accelerated in this region, and bombard the wafer normal
to the surface. This bombardment at normal incidence contributes a physical
component to the etch that makes it anisotropic. Physical etching, however,
is rather unselective. Simultaneously, the highly reactive radicals in the system give rise to a chemical etch component that is very selective, but not
anisotropic. The result is that RIE achieves a good compromise between
anisotropy and selectivity, and has become the mainstay of modern IC etch
technology.

5.1.8 Metallization
After the semiconductor devices are made by the processing methods
described previously, they have to be connected to each other, and ultimately
to the IC package, by metallization. Metal films are generally deposited by a
physical vapor deposition technique such as evaporation (e.g., Au on GaAs)
or sputtering (e.g., Al on Si). Sputtering of Al is achieved by immersing an Al
target (typically alloyed with ∼1, Si and ∼4, Cu to improve the electrical
and metallurgical properties of the Al, as described in Section 9.3.1) in an
Ar plasma. Argon ions bombard the Al and physically dislodge Al atoms by
momentum transfer (Fig. 5–9). Many of the Al atoms ejected from the target
deposit on the Si wafers held in close proximity to the target. The Al is then
patterned using the metallization reticle and subsequently etched by RIE.
Finally, it is sintered at ∼450°C for ∼30 minutes to form a good electrical,
ohmic contact to the Si.
Recently, for Si integrated circuits, there has been a shift from Al to lower
resistivity Cu metallization. Copper cannot be deposited by sputtering. Instead,
it is electroplated on the chips. Copper metallization introduces special challenges because Cu diffuses fast in Si, and acts as a deep trap. Hence, prior to the
electroplating of Cu, a barrier metal such as Ti is first sputter deposited to block
Cu diffusion into Si. The Ti also acts as a seed layer for Cu electrodeposition.
After the interconnection metallization is complete, a protective overcoat of silicon nitride is deposited using plasma-enhanced CVD. Then the
individual integrated circuits can be separated by sawing or by scribing and
breaking the wafer. The final steps of the process are mounting individual
devices in appropriate packages and connecting leads to the Al contact

regions. Very precise lead bonders are available for bonding Au or Al wire
(about one thousandth of an inch in diameter) to the device and then to the
package leads. This phase of device fabrication is called back-end processing,
and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
The main steps in making p-n junctions using some of these unit processes
are illustrated in Fig. 5–10. Similarly, we will discuss how the key semiconductor devices are made using these same unit processes in subsequent chapters.

Simplified description of steps in the fabrication of p-n junctions. For simplicity, only four diodes per

In this chapter we wish to develop both a useful mathematical description
of the p-n junction and a strong qualitative understanding of its properties.
There must be some compromise in these two goals, since a complete mathematical treatment would obscure the essentially simple physical features
5.2
equilibriuM
cOnDitiOnsJunctions 195
of junction operation, while a completely qualitative description would not
be useful in making calculations. The approach, therefore, will be to describe
the junction mathematically while neglecting small effects which add little
to the basic solution. In Section 5.6 we shall include several deviations from
the simple theory.
The mathematics of p-n junctions is greatly simplified for the case of
the step junction, which has uniform p doping on one side of a sharp junction
and uniform n doping on the other side. This model represents epitaxial junctions quite well; diffused or implanted junctions, however, are actually graded
(Nd - Na varies over a significant distance on either side of the junction).
After the basic ideas of junction theory are explored for the step junction,
we can make the appropriate corrections to extend the theory to the graded
junction. In these discussions we shall assume one-dimensional current flow
in samples of uniform cross-sectional area.
In this section we investigate the properties of the step junction at
equilibrium (i.e., with no external excitation and no net currents flowing in
the device). We shall find that the difference in doping on each side of the
junction causes a potential difference between the two types of material. This
is a reasonable result, since we would expect some charge transfer because
of diffusion between the p material (many holes) and the n material (many
electrons). In addition, we shall find that there are four components of current which flow across the junction due to the drift and diffusion of electrons
and holes. These four components combine to give zero net current for the
equilibrium case. However, the application of bias to the junction increases
some of these current components with respect to others, giving net current
flow. If we understand the nature of these four current components, a sound
view of p-n junction operation, with or without bias, will follow.
5.2.1 the contact Potential
Let us consider separate regions of p- and n-type semiconductor material,
brought together to form a junction (Fig. 5–11). This is not a practical way
of forming a device, but this “thought experiment” does allow us to discover
the requirements of equilibrium at a junction. Before they are joined, the n
material has a large concentration of electrons and few holes, whereas the
converse is true for the p material. Upon joining the two regions (Fig. 5–11),
we expect diffusion of carriers to take place because of the large carrier concentration gradients at the junction. Thus holes diffuse from the p side into
the n side, and electrons diffuse from n to p. The resulting diffusion current
cannot build up indefinitely, however, because an opposing electric field is
created at the junction (Fig. 5–11b). If the two regions were boxes of red air
molecules and green molecules (perhaps due to appropriate types of pollution), eventually there would be a homogeneous mixture of the two after
the boxes were joined. This cannot occur in the case of the charged particles
in a p-n junction because of the development of space charge and the electric field ℰ. If we consider that electrons diffusing from n to p leave behind196 Chapter 5
uncompensated3 donor ions (Nd+) in the n material, and holes leaving the p
region leave behind uncompensated acceptors (Na-), it is easy to visualize
the development of a region of positive space charge near the n side of the
junction and negative charge near the p side. The resulting electric field is
directed from the positive charge toward the negative charge. Thus ℰ is in the
direction opposite to that of diffusion current for each type of carrier (recall
electron current is opposite to the direction of electron flow). Therefore, the
3We recall that neutrality is maintained in the bulk materials of Fig. 5–11a by the presence of one electron
for each ionized donor (n = Nd+) in the n material and one hole for each ionized acceptor (p = Na-) in
the p material (neglecting minority carriers). Thus, if electrons leave n, some of the positive donor ions near
the junction are left uncompensated, as in Fig. 5–11b. The donors and acceptors are fixed in the lattice, in
contrast to the mobile electrons and holes.

field creates a drift component of current from n to p, opposing the diffusion
current (Fig. 5–11c).
Since we know that no net current can flow across the junction at equilibrium, the current due to the drift of carriers in the ℰ field must exactly
cancel the diffusion current. Furthermore, since there can be no net buildup
of electrons or holes on either side as a function of time, the drift and diffusion currents must cancel for each type of carrier:
Jp
(drift) + Jp(diff.) = 0 (5–3a)
Jn
(drift) + Jn(diff.) = 0 (5–3b)
Therefore, the electric field ℰ builds up to the point where the net current
is zero at equilibrium. The electric field appears in some region W about
the junction, and there is an equilibrium potential difference V0 across W.
In the electrostatic potential diagram of Fig. 5–11b, there is a gradient in
potential in the direction opposite to ℰ, in accordance with the fundamental
relation4 ℰ(x) = -d �(x) > dx. We assume the electric field is zero in the
neutral regions outside W. Thus there is a constant potential �n in the neutral
n material, a constant �p in the neutral p material, and a potential difference
V0 = �n - �p between the two. The region W is called the transition region,5
and the potential difference V0 is called the contact potential. The contact
potential appearing across W is a built-in potential barrier, in that it is necessary to the maintenance of equilibrium at the junction; it does not imply
any external potential. Indeed, the contact potential cannot be measured by
placing a voltmeter across the devices, because new contact potentials are
formed at each probe, just canceling V0. By definition V0 is an equilibrium
quantity, and no net current can result from it.
The contact potential separates the bands as in Fig. 5–11b; the valence
and conduction energy bands are higher on the p side of the junction than
on the n side6 by the amount qV0. The separation of the bands at equilibrium
is just that required to make the Fermi level constant throughout the device.
We discussed the lack of spatial variation of the Fermi level at equilibrium
in Section 3.5. Thus if we know the band diagram, including EF , for each
separate material (Fig. 5–11a), we can find the band separation for the junction at equilibrium simply by drawing a diagram such as Fig. 5–11b with the
Fermi levels aligned.
4When we write ℰ(x), we refer to the value of ℰ as computed in the x-direction. This value will of course
be negative, since it is directed opposite to the true direction of ℰ as shown in Fig. 5–11b.
5Other names for this region are the space charge region, since space charge exists within W while
neutrality is maintained outside this region, and the depletion region, since W is almost depleted of
carriers compared with the rest of the crystal. The contact potential V0 is also called the diffusion potential,
since it represents a potential barrier which diffusing carriers must surmount in going from one side of the
junction to the other.
6The electron energy diagram of Fig. 5–11b is related to the electrostatic potential diagram by -q, the
negative charge on the electron. Since �n is a higher potential than �p by the amount V0, the electron
energies on the n side are lower than those on the p side by qV0.198 Chapter 5
To obtain a quantitative relationship between V0 and the doping concentrations on each side of the junction, we must use the requirements for
equilibrium in the drift and diffusion current equations. For example, the
drift and diffusion components of the hole current just cancel at equilibrium:
Jp
(x) = qc opp(x)ℰ(x) - Dpdpdx (x) d = 0 (5–4a)
This equation can be rearranged to obtain

where the x-direction is arbitrarily taken from p to n. The electric field can
be written in terms of the gradient in the potential, ℰ(x) = -d�(x) > dx, so
that Eq. (5–4b) becomes

d�(x)
dx =

p(x)

with the use of the Einstein relation for op>Dp. This equation can be solved
by integration over the appropriate limits. In this case we are interested in
the potential on either side of the junction, �p and �n, and the hole concentration just at the edge of the transition region on either side, pp and pn. For
a step junction it is reasonable to take the electron and hole concentration in
the neutral regions outside the transition region as their equilibrium values.
Since we have assumed a one-dimensional geometry, p and � can be taken
reasonably as functions of x only. Integration of Eq. (5–5) gives

The potential difference �n - �p is the contact potential V0 (Fig. 5–11b).
Thus we can write V0 in terms of the equilibrium hole concentrations on
either side of the junction:

5.2.2 equilibrium Fermi levels
We have observed that the Fermi level must be constant throughout
the device at equilibrium. This observation can be easily related to the
results of the previous section. Since we have assumed that pn and pp
are given by their equilibrium values outside the transition region, we
can write Eq. (5–9) in terms of the basic definitions of these quantities
using Eq. (3–19):
pp
pn
= eqV0>kT = Nve-(EFp - Evp)>kT
Nv
e-(EFn - Evn)>kT (5–11a)
eqV0>kT = e(EFn - EFp)>kTe(Evp - Evn)>kT (5–11b)
qV0 = Evp - Evn (5–12)
The Fermi level and valence band energies are written with subscripts to
indicate the p side and the n side of the junction.
From Fig. 5–11b the energy bands on either side of the junction are
separated by the contact potential V0 times the electronic charge q; thus
the energy difference Evp - Evn is just qV0. Equation (5–12) results from
the fact that the Fermi levels on either side of the junction are equal at
equilibrium (EFn - EFp = 0). When bias is applied to the junction, the
potential barrier is raised or lowered from the value of the contact potential, and the Fermi levels on either side of the junction are shifted with
respect to each other by an energy in electron volts numerically equal to
the applied voltage in volts.
5.2.3 space charge at a Junction
Within the transition region, electrons and holes are in transit from one side
of the junction to the other. Some electrons diffuse from n to p, and some
are swept by the electric field from p to n (and conversely for holes); there
are, however, very few carriers within the transition region at any given time,
since the electric field serves to sweep out carriers which have wandered
into W. To a good approximation, we can consider the space charge within
the transition region as due only to the uncompensated donor and acceptor
ions. The charge density within W is plotted in Fig. 5–12b. Neglecting carriers within the space charge region, the charge density on the n side is just q
times the concentration of donor ions Nd, and the negative charge density
on the p side is -q times the concentration of acceptors Na. The assumption
of carrier depletion within W and neutrality outside W is known as the
depletion approximation.Junctions 201
Since the dipole about the junction must have an equal number of
charges on either side,7 (Q+ = ∙ Q- ∙), the transition region may extend
into the p and n regions unequally, depending on the relative doping of the
two sides. For example, if the p side is more lightly doped than the n side
(Na 6 Nd), the space charge region must extend farther into the p material
than into the n, to “uncover” an equivalent amount of charge. For a sample
of cross-sectional area A, the total uncompensated charge on either side of
the junction is
qAxp0Na = qAxn0Nd (5–13)
7A simple way of remembering this equal charge requirement is to note that electric flux lines must begin
and end on charges of opposite sign. Therefore, if Q+ and Q- were not of equal magnitude, the electric
field would not be contained within W but would extend farther into the p or n regions until the enclosed
charges became equal.

where x
p0 is the penetration of the space charge region into the p material,
and x
n0 is the penetration into n. The total width of the transition region (W)
is the sum of x
p0 and xn0.
To calculate the electric field distribution within the transition region,
we begin with Poisson’s equation, which relates the gradient of the electric
field to the local space charge at any point x:
dℰ(x)
dx =
q P
(p - n + Nd+ - Na-) (5–14)
This equation is greatly simplified within the transition region if we neglect
the contribution of the carriers (p-n) to the space charge. With this approximation we have two regions of constant space charge:

Nd, 0 6 x 6 xn0 (5–15a)
dℰ
dx = -
q P
Na
, - xp0 6 x 6 0 (5–15b)
assuming complete ionization of the impurities (Nd+ = Nd) and (Na- = Na).
We can see from these two equations that a plot of ℰ(x) vs. x within the
transition region has two slopes, positive (ℰ increasing with x) on the n side
and negative (ℰ becoming more negative as x increases) on the p side. There
is some maximum value of the field ℰ0 at x = 0 (the metallurgical junction
between the p and n materials), and ℰ(x) is everywhere negative within
the transition region (Fig. 5–12c). These conclusions come from Gauss’s law,
but we could predict the qualitative features of Fig. 5–12 without equations.
We expect the electric field ℰ(x) to be negative throughout W, since we
know that the ℰ field actually points in the -x@direction, from n to p (i.e.,
from the positive charges of the transition region dipole toward the negative
charges). The electric field is assumed to go to zero at the edges of the transition region, since we are neglecting any small ℰ field in the neutral n or p
regions. Finally, there must be a maximum ℰ0 at the junction, since this point
is between the charges Q+ and Q - on either side of the transition region.
All the electric flux lines pass through the x = 0 plane, so this is the obvious
point of maximum electric field.
The value of ℰ0 can be found by integrating either part of Eq. (5–15)
with appropriate limits (see Fig. 5–12c in choosing the limits of integration).

There are several useful variations of Eq. (5–21); for example, V0 can
be written in terms of the doping concentrations with the aid of Eq. (5–8):
W = c 2PqkT 2 alnNnaN2 i d baN1a + N1d b d 1>2 (5–22)

As expected, Eqs. (5–23) predict that the transition region extends farther into the side with the lighter doping. For example, if Na ⪡ Nd, xp0 is
large compared with xn0. This agrees with our qualitative argument that a204 Chapter 5
deep penetration is necessary in lightly doped material to “uncover” the same
amount of space charge as for a short penetration into heavily doped material.
Another important result of Eq. (5–21) is that the transition width W
varies as the square root of the potential across the region. In the derivation
to this point, we have considered only the equilibrium contact potential V0.
In Section 5.3 we shall see that an applied voltage can increase or decrease
the potential across the transition region by aiding or opposing the equilibrium electric field. Therefore, Eq. (5–21) predicts that an applied voltage will
increase or decrease the width of the transition region as well.

One useful feature of a p-n junction is that current flows quite freely in the
p to n direction when the p region has a positive external voltage bias relative
to n (forward bias and forward current), whereas virtually no current flows
when p is made negative relative to n (reverse bias and reverse current).
This asymmetry of the current flow makes the p-n junction diode very useful as a rectifier. While rectification is an important application, it is only the
beginning of a host of uses for the biased junction. Biased p-n junctions can
be used as voltage-variable capacitors, photocells, light emitters, and many
more devices which are basic to modern electronics. Two or more junctions
can be used to form transistors and controlled switches.
In this section we begin with a qualitative description of current flow
in a biased junction. With the background of the previous section, the basic
features of current flow are relatively simple to understand, and these qualitative concepts form the basis for the analytical description of forward and
reverse currents in a junction.
5.3.1 qualitative Description of current Flow at a Junction
We assume that an applied voltage bias V appears across the transition
region of the junction rather than in the neutral n and p regions. Of course,
there will be some voltage drop in the neutral material, if a current flows
through it. But in most p-n junction devices, the length of each region is small
compared with its area, and the doping is usually moderate to heavy; thus
the resistance is small in each neutral region, and only a small voltage drop
can be maintained outside the space charge (transition) region. For almost
all calculations it is valid to assume that an applied voltage appears entirely
across the transition region. We shall take V to be positive when the external
bias is positive on the p side relative to the n side.
Since an applied voltage changes the electrostatic potential barrier and
thus the electric field within the transition region, we would expect changes
in the various components of current at the junction (Fig. 5–13). In addition,
the separation of the energy bands is affected by the applied bias, along
with the width of the depletion region. Let us begin by examining qualitatively the effects of bias on the important features of the junction.
The electrostatic potential barrier at the junction is lowered by a forward bias V
f from the equilibrium contact potential V0 to the smaller value
V0 - Vf. This lowering of the potential barrier occurs because a forward bias
(p positive with respect to n) raises the electrostatic potential on the p side
relative to the n side. For a reverse bias (V = -Vr) the opposite occurs; the
electrostatic potential of the p side is depressed relative to the n side, and the
potential barrier at the junction becomes larger (V0 + Vr).
The electric field within the transition region can be deduced from the
potential barrier. We notice that the field decreases with forward bias, since
the applied electric field opposes the built-in field. With reverse bias the field
at the junction is increased by the applied field, which is in the same direction
as the equilibrium field.
The change in electric field at the junction calls for a change in the transition region width W, since it is still necessary that a proper number of positive

Effects of a bias at a p-n junction; transition region width and electric field, electrostatic potential, energy
band diagram, and particle flow and current directions within W for (a) equilibrium, (b) forward bias,
and (c) reverse bias. The electric fields vary linearly with position, as shown in Fig. 5–12, if the doping
concentrations in the depletion regions are constant on either side of the junction. Since the electrostatic
potential is obtained by integrating the (linearly varying) electric fields as shown in Eq. (5–18), the potential
profiles (and band edges) vary as the square of distance from the depletion edges. Therefore, the shape of
the band diagram in the depletion region is not linear, but consists of two parabolic curves that join smoothly.Junctions 207
and negative charges (in the form of uncompensated donor and acceptor ions)
be exposed for a given value of the ℰ field. Thus we would expect the width
W to decrease under forward bias (smaller ℰ, fewer uncompensated charges)
and to increase under reverse bias. Equations (5–21) and (5–23) can be used to
calculate W, xp0, and xn0 if V0 is replaced by the new barrier height8 V0 - V.
The separation of the energy bands is a direct function of the electrostatic potential barrier at the junction. The height of the electron energy
barrier is simply the electronic charge q times the height of the electrostatic
potential barrier. Thus the bands are separated less [q(V0 - Vf)] under forward bias than at equilibrium, and more [q(V0 + Vr)] under reverse bias.
We assume the Fermi level deep inside each neutral region is essentially the
equilibrium value (we shall return to this assumption later); therefore, the
shifting of the energy bands under bias implies a separation of the Fermi
levels on either side of the junction, as mentioned in Section 5.2.2. Under
forward bias, the Fermi level on the n side EFn is above EFp by the energy qVf;
for reverse bias, EFp is qVr joules higher than EFn. In energy units of electron
volts, the Fermi levels in the two neutral regions are separated by an energy
(eV) numerically equal to the applied voltage (V).
The diffusion current is composed of majority carrier electrons on the
n side surmounting the potential energy barrier to diffuse to the p side, and
holes surmounting their barrier from p to n.9There is a distribution of energies
for electrons in the n-side conduction band (Fig. 3–16), and some electrons
in the high-energy “tail” of the distribution have enough energy to diffuse
from n to p at equilibrium in spite of the barrier. With forward bias, however,
the barrier is lowered (to V0 - Vf), and many more electrons in the n-side
conduction band have sufficient energy to diffuse from n to p over the smaller
barrier. Therefore, the electron diffusion current can be quite large with forward bias. Similarly, more holes can diffuse from p to n under forward bias
because of the lowered barrier. For reverse bias the barrier becomes so large
(V0 + Vr) that virtually no electrons in the n-side conduction band or holes
in the p-side valence band have enough energy to surmount it. Therefore, the
diffusion current is usually negligible for reverse bias.
The drift current is relatively insensitive to the height of the potential
barrier. This sounds strange at first, since we normally think in terms of material with ample carriers, and therefore we expect drift current to be simply
proportional to the applied field. The reason for this apparent anomaly is the
fact that the drift current is limited not by how fast carriers are swept down
the barrier, but rather how often. For example, minority carrier electrons on
the p side which wander into the transition region will be swept down the
8With bias applied to the junction, the 0 in the subscripts of xn0 and xp0 does not imply equilibrium. Instead,
it signifies the origin of a new set of coordinates, xn = 0 and xp = 0, as defined later in Fig. 5–15.
9Remember that the potential energy barriers for electrons and holes are directed oppositely. The barrier
for electrons is apparent from the energy band diagram, which is always drawn for electron energies. For
holes, the potential energy barrier at the junction has the same shape as the electrostatic potential barrier
(the conversion factor between electrostatic potential and hole energy is +q). A simple check of these two
barrier directions can be made by asking the directions in which carriers are swept by the ℰ field within the
transition region–a hole is swept in the direction of ℰ, from n to p (swept down the potential “hill” for holes);
an electron is swept opposite to ℰ, from p to n (swept down the potential energy “hill” for electrons).208 Chapter 5
barrier by the ℰ field, giving rise to the electron component of drift current.
However, this current is small not because of the size of the barrier, but because
there are very few minority electrons in the p side to participate. Every electron on the p side which diffuses to the transition region will be swept down
the potential energy hill, whether the hill is large or small. The electron drift
current does not depend on how fast an individual electron is swept from p to
n, but rather on how many electrons are swept down the barrier per second.
Similar comments apply regarding the drift of minority holes from the n side
to the p side of the junction. To a good approximation, therefore, the electron
and hole drift currents at the junction are independent of the applied voltage.
The supply of minority carriers on each side of the junction required to
participate in the drift component of current is generated by thermal excitation
of electron–hole pairs (EHPs). For example, an EHP created near the junction
on the p side provides a minority electron in the p material. If the EHP is generated within a diffusion length Ln of the transition region, this electron can diffuse
to the junction and be swept down the barrier to the n side. The resulting current
due to drift of generated carriers across the junction is commonly called the generation current since its magnitude depends entirely on the rate of generation of
EHPs. As we shall discuss later, this generation current can be increased greatly
by optical excitation of EHPs near the junction (the p-n junction photodiode).
The total current crossing the junction is composed of the sum of the
diffusion and drift components. As Fig. 5–13 indicates, the electron and hole
diffusion currents are both directed from p to n (although the particle flow
directions are opposite to each other), and the drift currents are from n to
p. The net current crossing the junction is zero at equilibrium, since the drift
and diffusion components cancel for each type of carrier (the equilibrium
electron and hole components need not be equal, as in Fig. 5–13, as long
as the net hole current and the net electron current are each zero). Under
reverse bias, both diffusion components are negligible because of the large
barrier at the junction, and the only current is the relatively small (and essentially voltage-independent) generation current from n to p. This generation
current is shown in Fig. 5–14, in a sketch of a typical I–V plot for a p-n junction. In this figure the positive direction for the current I is taken from p to
n, and the applied voltage V is positive when the positive battery terminal
is connected to p and the negative terminal to n. The only current flowing
in this p-n junction diode for negative V is the small current I(gen.) due to
carriers generated in the transition region or minority carriers which diffuse
to the junction and are collected. The current at V = 0 (equilibrium) is zero
since the generation and diffusion currents cancel:10
I = I(diff.) - ∙ I(gen.) ∙ = 0 for V = 0 (5–24)
10The total current I is the sum of the generation and diffusion components. However, these components
are oppositely directed, with I(diff.) being positive and I(gen.) being negative for the chosen reference
direction. To avoid confusion of signs, we use here the magnitude of the drift current ∙I(gen.)∙ and
include its negative sign in Eq. (5–24). Thus, when we write the term - ∙I(gen.)∙, there is no doubt that
the generation current is in the negative current direction. This approach emphasizes the fact that the two
components of current add with opposite signs to give the total current.Junctions 209
As we shall see in the next section, an applied forward bias V = Vf
increases the probability that a carrier can diffuse across the junction, by
the factor exp(qVf>kT). Thus the diffusion current under forward bias is
given by its equilibrium value multiplied by exp(qV>kT); similarly, for
reverse bias the diffusion current is the equilibrium value reduced by the
same factor, with V = -Vr. Since the equilibrium diffusion current is equal
in magnitude to ∙ I(gen.) ∙ , the diffusion current with applied bias is simply
∙ I(gen.) ∙ exp(qV>kT). The total current I is then the diffusion current minus
the absolute value of the generation current, which we will now refer to as I0:
I = I0(eqV>kT - 1) (5–25)
In Eq. (5–25) the applied voltage V can be positive or negative,
V = V
f or V = -Vr. When V is positive and greater than a few kT>q
(kT>q = 0.0259 V at room temperature), the exponential term is much
greater than unity. The current thus increases exponentially with forward
bias. When V is negative (reverse bias), the exponential term approaches
zero and the current is -I0, which is in the n to p (negative) direction. This
negative generation current is also called the reverse saturation current. The
striking feature of Fig. 5–14 is the nonlinearity of the I–V characteristic.
Current flows relatively freely in the forward direction of the diode, but
almost no current flows in the reverse direction.
5.3.2 carrier injection
From the discussion in the previous section, we expect the minority carrier
concentration on each side of a p-n junction to vary with the applied bias
because of variations in the diffusion of carriers across the junction. The
equilibrium ratio of hole concentrations on each side

p(-xp0)
p(xn0) = eq(V0 - V)>kT (5–27)
This equation uses the altered barrier V0 - V to relate the steady state
hole concentrations on the two sides of the transition region with either forward or reverse bias (V positive or negative). For low-level injection we can
neglect changes in the majority carrier concentrations. Although the absolute
increase of the majority carrier concentration is equal to the increase of the
minority carrier concentration in order to maintain space charge neutrality,
the relative change in majority carrier concentration can be assumed to vary
only slightly with bias compared with equilibrium values. With this simplification we can write the ratio of Eq. (5–26) to (5–27) as
p(xn0)
pn
= eqV>kT taking p(-xp0) = pp (5–28)
With forward bias, Eq. (5–28) suggests a greatly increased minority carrier
hole concentration at the edge of the transition region on the n side p(xn0)
than was the case at equilibrium. Conversely, the hole concentration p(xn0)
under reverse bias (V negative) is reduced below the equilibrium value pn.
The exponential increase of the hole concentration at xn0 with forward bias is
an example of minority carrier injection. As Fig. 5–15 suggests, a forward bias
V results in a steady state injection of excess holes into the n region and electrons into the p region. We can easily calculate the excess hole concentration
∆pn at the edge of the transition region xn0 by subtracting the equilibrium
hole concentration from Eq. (5–28),
∆pn = p(xn0) - pn = pn(eqV>kT - 1) (5–29)
and similarly for excess electrons on the p side,
∆n
p = n(- xp0) - np = np(eqV>kT - 1) (5–30)
From our study of diffusion of excess carriers in Section 4.4.4, we
expect that injection leading to a steady concentration of ∆pn excess holes
at x
n0 will produce a distribution of excess holes in the n material. As the
holes diffuse deeper into the n region, they recombine with electrons in
the n material, and the resulting excess hole distribution is obtained as a
solution of the diffusion equation, Eq. (4–34b). If the n region is long compared with the hole diffusion length Lp, the solution is exponential, as in
Eq. (4–36). Similarly, the injected electrons in the p material diffuse and
recombine, giving an exponential distribution of excess electrons. For convenience, let us define two new coordinates (Fig. 5–15): Distances measured
in the x-direction in the n material from x
n0 will be designated xn; distances
in the p material measured in the -x@direction with -xp0 as the origin willJunctions 211
be called x
p. This convention will simplify the mathematics considerably. We
can write the diffusion equation as in Eq. (4–34) for each side of the junction and solve for the distributions of excess carriers (dn and dp) assuming
long p and n regions:
dn(xp) = ∆npe-xp>Ln = np(eqV>kT - 1)e-xp>Ln (5–31a)
dp(xn) = ∆pne-xn>Lp = pn(eqV>kT - 1)e-xn>Lp (5–31b)
The hole diffusion current at any point xn in the n material can be
calculated from Eq. (4–40):

The minus sign in Eq. (5–34) means that the electron current is opposite to
the x
p-direction; that is, the true direction of In is in the +x@direction, adding to Ip in the total current (Fig. 5–16). If we neglect recombination in the
transition region, which is known as the Shockley ideal diode approximation, we can consider that each injected electron reaching -xp0 must pass
through xn0. Thus the total diode current I at xn0 can be calculated as the
sum of I
p(xn = 0) and -In(xp = 0). If we take the +x@direction as the reference direction for the total current I, we must use a minus sign with In(xp) to
account for the fact that x
p is defined in the -x@direction:

Equation (5–36) is the diode equation, having the same form as the
qualitative relation Eq. (5–25). Nothing in the derivation excludes the possibility that the bias voltage V can be negative; thus the diode equation
describes the total current through the diode for either forward or reverse
bias. We can calculate the current for reverse bias by letting V = -Vr:
I = qAaDLpppn + DLnnnpb(e-qVr>kT - 1) (5–37a)
If V
r is larger than a few kT>q, the total current is just the reverse saturation
current
I = -qAaDLpppn + DLnnnpb = -I0 (5–37b)
11With carrier injection due to bias, it is clear that the equilibrium Fermi levels cannot be used to describe
carrier concentrations in the device. It is necessary to use the concept of quasi-Fermi levels, taking into
account the spatial variations of the carrier concentrations.Junctions 213

Two methods
for calculating
junction current
from the excess
minority carrier
distributions:
(a) diffusion
currents at the
edges of the
transition region;
(b) charge in
the distributions
divided by the
minority carrier
lifetimes; (c) the
diode equation.214 Chapter 5
One implication of Eq. (5–36) is that the total current at the junction
is dominated by injection of carriers from the more heavily doped side into
the side with lesser doping. For example, if the p material is very heavily
doped and the n region is lightly doped, the minority carrier concentration
on the p side (np) is negligible compared with the minority carrier concentration on the n side (pn). Thus the diode equation can be approximated by
injection of holes only, as in Eq. (5–33). This means that the charge stored
in the minority carrier distributions is due mostly to holes on the n side. For
example, to double the hole current in this p+-n junction one should not
double the p+ doping, but rather reduce the n-type doping by a factor of
two. This structure is called a p+-n junction, where the + superscript simply
means heavy doping. Another characteristic of the p+-n or n+-p structure is
that the transition region extends primarily into the lightly doped region, as
we found in the discussion of Eq. (5–23). Having one side heavily doped is a
useful arrangement for many practical devices, as we shall see in our discussions of switching diodes and transistors. This type of junction is common in
devices which are fabricated by counterdoping. For example, an n-type Si
sample with Nd = 1014 cm - 3 can be used as the substrate for an implanted
or diffused junction. If the doping of the p region is greater than 1019 cm - 3
(typical of diffused junctions), the structure is definitely p+-n, with np more
than five orders of magnitude smaller than pn. Since this configuration is
common in device technology, we shall return to it in much of the following
discussion.
Figure 5–15b shows the quasi-Fermi levels as a function of position
for a p-n junction in forward bias. The equilibrium EF is split into the quasiFermi levels F
n and Fp which are separated within W by an energy qV caused
by the applied bias, V. This energy represents the deviation from equilibrium
(see Section 4.3.3). In forward bias in the depletion region we thus get
pn = n2 i e(Fn - Fp)>kT = n2 i e(qV>kT) (5–38)
On either side of the junction, it is the minority carrier quasi-Fermi
level that varies the most. The majority carrier concentration is not affected
much, so the majority carrier quasi-Fermi level is close to the original EF.
Although there is some variation in EF and Fp within W, it doesn’t show up
on the scale used in Fig. 5–15. Outside of the depletion regions, the quasiFermi levels for the minority carriers vary linearly and eventually merge
with the Fermi levels. In contrast, the minority carrier concentrations decay
exponentially with distance. In fact it takes many diffusion lengths for the
quasi-Fermi level to cross Ei, where the minority carrier concentration is
equal to the intrinsic carrier concentration, let alone approach EF,where for
example dp(xn) ≃ pn.
Another simple and instructive way of calculating the total current is
to consider the injected current as supplying the carriers for the excess distributions (Fig. 5–16b). For example, Ip(xn = 0) must supply enough holes
per second to maintain the steady state exponential distribution ∆p(xn) asJunctions 215
the holes recombine. The total positive charge stored in the excess carrier
distribution at any instant of time is
Qp = qA L0 ∞dp(xn)dxn = qA∆pn L0 ∞e-xn>Lpdxn = qALp∆pn (5–39)
The average lifetime of a hole in the n-type material is vp. Thus, on the
average, this entire charge distribution recombines and must be replenished
every vp seconds. The injected hole current at xn = 0 needed to maintain
the distribution is simply the total charge divided by the average time of
replacement:

using Dp>Lp = Lp>vp.
This is the same result as Eq. (5–33), which was calculated from the
diffusion currents. Similarly, we can calculate the negative charge stored in
the distribution dn(xp) and divide by vn to obtain the injected electron current in the p material. This method, called the charge control approximation, illustrates the important fact that the minority carriers injected into
either side of a p-n junction diffuse into the neutral material and recombine
with the majority carriers. The minority carrier current [for example, Ip(xn)]
decreases exponentially with distance into the neutral region. Thus several
diffusion lengths away from the junction, most of the total current is carried
by the majority carriers. We shall discuss this point in more detail later in
this section.
In summary, we can calculate the current at a p-n junction in two ways
(Fig. 5–16): (a) from the slopes of the excess minority carrier distributions at
the two edges of the transition regions and (b) from the steady state charge
stored in each distribution. We add the hole current injected into the n material I
p(xn = 0) to the electron current injected into the p material Ip(xp = 0),
after including a minus sign with In(xp) to conform with the conventional definition of positive current in the +x@direction. We are able to add these two
currents because of the assumption that no recombination takes place within
the transition region. Thus we effectively have the total electron and hole current at one point in the device (xn0). Since the total current must be constant
throughout the device (despite variations in the current components), I as
described by Eq. (5–36) is the total current at every position x in the diode.
The drift of minority carriers can be neglected in the neutral regions
outside W, because the minority carrier concentration is small compared with
that of the majority carriers. If the minority carriers contribute to the total
current at all, their contribution must be through diffusion (dependent on
the gradient of the carrier concentration). Even a very small concentration of
minority carriers can have an appreciable effect on the current if the spatial
variation is large.216 Chapter 5
Calculation of the majority carrier currents in the two neutral regions
is simple, once we have found the minority carrier current. Since the total
current I must be constant throughout the device, the majority carrier component of current at any point is just the difference between I and the minority component (Fig. 5–17). For example, since Ip(xn) is proportional to the
excess hole concentration at each position in the n material [Eq. (5–32)], it
decreases exponentially in xn with the decreasing dp(xn). Thus the electron
component of current must increase appropriately with xn to maintain the
total current I. Far from the junction, the current in the n material is carried
almost entirely by electrons. The physical explanation of this is that electrons
must flow in from the n material (and ultimately from the negative terminal
of the battery), to resupply electrons lost by recombination in the excess hole
distribution near the junction. The electron current In(xn) includes sufficient
electron flow to supply not only recombination near xn0, but also injection of
electrons into the p region. Of course, the flow of electrons in the n material
toward the junction constitutes a current in the +x@direction, contributing
to the total current I.
One question that still remains to be answered is whether the majority
carrier current is due to drift or diffusion or both, at different points in the

diode. Near the junction (just outside of the depletion regions) the majority carrier concentration changes by exactly the same amount as minority
carriers in order to maintain space charge neutrality. The majority carrier
concentration can change rather fast, in a very short time scale known as
the dielectric relaxation time, vD(=rP), where r is the resistivity and P is
the dielectric constant. The relaxation time tD is the analog of the RC time
constant in a circuit. Very far away from the junction (more than 3 to 5 diffusion lengths), the minority carrier concentration decays to a low, constant
background value. Hence, the majority carrier concentration also becomes
independent of position. Here, clearly the only possible current component is
majority carrier drift current. When approaching the junction there is a spatially varying majority (and minority) carrier concentration and the majority
carrier current changes from pure drift to drift and diffusion, although drift
always dominates for majority carriers except in cases of very high levels of
injection. Throughout the diode, the total current due to majority and minority carriers at any cross section is kept constant.
We thus note that the electric field in the neutral regions cannot be zero
as we previously assumed; otherwise, there would be no drift currents. Thus
our assumption that all of the applied voltage appears across the transition
region is not completely accurate. On the other hand, the majority carrier
concentrations are usually large in the neutral regions, so that only a small
field is needed to drive the drift currents. Thus the assumption that junction
voltage equals applied voltage is acceptable for most calculations.

5.3.3 reverse bias
In our discussion of carrier injection and minority carrier distributions, we
have primarily assumed forward bias. The distributions for reverse bias can
be obtained from the same equations (Fig. 5–18), if a negative value of V is
introduced. For example, if V = -Vr (p negatively biased with respect to n),
we can approximate Eq. (5–29) as
∆pn = pn(eq( - Vr)>kT - 1)≃ -pn for Vr W kT > q (5–41)
and similarly ∆np≃ -np.
Thus for a reverse bias of more than a few tenths of a volt, the minority carrier concentration at each edge of the transition region becomes

essentially zero as the excess concentration approaches the negative of the
equilibrium concentration. The excess minority carrier concentrations in
the neutral regions are still given by Eq. (5–31), so that depletion of carriers below the equilibrium values extends approximately a diffusion length
beyond each side of the transition region. This reverse-bias depletion of
minority carriers can be thought of as minority carrier extraction, analogous
to the injection of forward bias. Physically, extraction occurs because minority carriers at the edges of the depletion region are swept down the barrier at
the junction to the other side and are not replaced by an opposing diffusion
of carriers. For example, when holes at xn0 are swept across the junction to
the p side by the ℰ field, a gradient in the hole distribution in the n material exists, and holes in the n region diffuse toward the junction. The steady
state hole distribution in the n region has the inverted exponential shape
of Fig. 5–18a. It is important to remember that although the reverse saturation current occurs at the junction by drift of carriers down the barrier, this
current is fed from each side by diffusion toward the junction of minority
carriers in the neutral regions. The rate of carrier drift across the junction
(reverse saturation current) depends on the rate at which holes arrive at xn0
(and electrons at xp0) by diffusion from the neutral material. These minority carriers are supplied by thermal generation, and we can show that the
expression for the reverse saturation current, Eq. (5–38), represents the rate
at which carriers are generated thermally within a diffusion length of each
side of the transition region.
In reverse bias, the quasi-Fermi levels split in the opposite sense than
in forward bias (Fig. 5–18b). The Fn moves farther away from Ec (close to Ev)
and F
p moves farther away from Ev, reflecting the fact that in reverse bias we
have fewer carriers than in equilibrium, unlike the forward bias case where
we have an excess of carriers. In reverse bias, in the depletion region, we have
pn = n2 i e (Fn - Fp)>kT ≈ 0 (5–42)
It is interesting to note that the quasi-Fermi levels in reverse bias can go
inside the bands. For example, Fp goes inside the conduction band on the n
side of the depletion region. However, we must remember that Fp is a measure of the hole concentration, and should be correlated with the valence
band edge, Ev, and not with Ec. Hence, the band diagram simply reflects the
fact that we have very few holes in this region, even fewer than the already
small equilibrium minority carrier hole concentration (Fig. 5–18a). Similar
observations can be made about the electrons.

We have found that a p-n junction biased in the reverse direction exhibits a small, essentially voltage-independent saturation current. This is true
until a critical reverse bias is reached, for which reverse breakdown occurs
(Fig. 5–19). At this critical voltage (Vbr) the reverse current through the diode
increases sharply, and relatively large currents can flow with little further
increase in voltage. The existence of a critical breakdown voltage introduces
almost a right-angle appearance to the reverse characteristic of most diodes.
There is nothing inherently destructive about reverse breakdown. If the
current is limited to a reasonable value by the external circuit, the p-n junction can be operated in reverse breakdown as safely as in the forward-bias
5.4

condition. For example, the maximum reverse current which can flow in the
device of Fig. 5–19 is (E - Vbr)>R; the series resistance R can be chosen to
limit the current to a safe level for the particular diode used. If the current is
not limited externally, the junction can be damaged by excessive reverse current, which overheats the device as the maximum power rating is exceeded. It
is important to remember, however, that such destruction of the device is not
necessarily due to mechanisms unique to reverse breakdown; similar results
occur if the device passes excessive current in the forward direction.12 As we
shall see in Section 5.4.4, useful devices called breakdown diodes are designed
to operate in the reverse breakdown regime of their characteristics.
Reverse breakdown can occur by two mechanisms, each of which
requires a critical electric field in the junction transition region. The first
mechanism, called the Zener effect, is operative at low voltages (up to a few
volts reverse bias). If the breakdown occurs at higher voltages (from a few
volts to thousands of volts), the mechanism is avalanche breakdown. We shall
discuss these two mechanisms in this section.
5.4.1 Zener breakdown
When a heavily doped junction is reverse biased, the energy bands become
crossed at relatively low voltages (i.e., the n-side conduction band appears
opposite the p-side valence band). As Fig. 5–20 indicates, the crossing of
the bands aligns the large number of empty states in the n-side conduction

regime than it would be for the forward bias, simply because V is greater.222 Chapter 5
band opposite the many filled states of the p-side valence band. If the barrier separating these two bands is narrow, tunneling of electrons can occur,
as discussed in Section 2.4.4. Tunneling of electrons from the p-side valence
band to the n-side conduction band constitutes a reverse current from n to p;
this is the Zener effect.
The basic requirements for tunneling current are a large number of
electrons separated from a large number of empty states by a narrow barrier
of finite height. Since the tunneling probability depends upon the width of
the barrier (d in Fig. 5–20), it is important that the metallurgical junction be
sharp and the doping high, so that the transition region W extends only a very
short distance from each side of the junction. If the junction is not abrupt,
or if either side of the junction is lightly doped, the transition region W will
be too wide for tunneling.
As the bands are crossed (at a few tenths of a volt for a heavily doped
junction), the tunneling distance d may be too large for appreciable tunneling. However, d becomes smaller as the reverse bias is increased, because the
higher electric fields result in steeper slopes for the band edges. This assumes
that the transition region width W does not increase appreciably with reverse
bias. For low voltages and heavy doping on each side of the junction, this is a
good assumption. However, if Zener breakdown does not occur with reverse
bias of a few volts, avalanche breakdown will become dominant.
In the simple covalent bonding model (Fig. 3–1), the Zener effect can
be thought of as field ionization of the host atoms at the junction. That is, the
reverse bias of a heavily doped junction causes a large electric field within W;
at a critical field strength, electrons participating in covalent bonds may be torn
from the bonds by the field and accelerated to the n side of the junction. The
electric field required for this type of ionization is on the order of 106 V/cm.
5.4.2 avalanche breakdown
For lightly doped junctions electron tunneling is negligible, and instead, the
breakdown mechanism involves the impact ionization of host atoms by energetic carriers. Normal lattice-scattering events can result in the creation of

EHPs if the carrier being scattered has sufficient energy. For example, if the
electric field ℰ in the transition region is large, an electron entering from the
p side may be accelerated to high enough kinetic energy to cause an ionizing
collision with the lattice (Fig. 5–21a). A single such interaction results in carrier multiplication; the original electron and the generated electron are both
swept to the n side of the junction, and the generated hole is swept to the
p side (Fig. 5–21b). The degree of multiplication can become very high if carriers generated within the transition region also have ionizing collisions with
the lattice. For example, an incoming electron may have a collision with the
lattice and create an EHP; each of these carriers has a chance of creating a
new EHP, and each of those can also create an EHP, and so forth (Fig. 5–21c).

This is an avalanche process, since each incoming carrier can initiate the
creation of a large number of new carriers.
We can make an approximate analysis of avalanche multiplication by
assuming that a carrier of either type has a probability P of having an ionizing collision with the lattice while being accelerated a distance W through
the transition region. Thus for nin electrons entering from the p side, there
will be Pnin ionizing collisions and an EHP (secondary carriers) for each collision. After the Pnin collisions by the primary electrons, we have the primary
plus the secondary electrons, nin(1 + P). After a collision, each EHP moves
effectively a distance of W within the transition region. For example, if an
EHP is created at the center of the region, the electron drifts a distance W>2
to n and the hole W>2 to p. Thus the probability that an ionizing collision will
occur due to the motion of the secondary carriers is still P in this simplified
model. For ninP secondary pairs there will be (ninP)P ionizing collisions and
ninP2 tertiary pairs. Summing up the total number of electrons out of the
region at n after many collisions, we have
nout = nin(1 + P + P2 + P3 + c ) (5–43)
assuming no recombination. In a more comprehensive theory we would
include recombination as well as different probabilities for ionizing collisions
by electrons and holes. In our simple theory, the electron multiplication Mn is

=

nin

1 - P (5–44a)
as can be verified by direct division. As the probability of ionization P
approaches unity, the carrier multiplication (and therefore the reverse current through the junction) increases without limit. Actually, the limit on the
current will be dictated by the external circuit.
The relation between multiplication and P was easy to write in
Eq. (5–44a); however, the relation of P to parameters of the junction is
much more complicated. Physically, we expect the ionization probability to
increase with increasing electric field, and therefore to depend on the reverse
bias. Measurements of carrier multiplication M in junctions near breakdown
lead to an empirical relation
M =
1
1 - (V > Vbr)n (5–44b)
where the exponent n varies from about 3 to 6, depending on the type of
material used for the junction.
In general, the critical reverse voltage for breakdown increases with the
band gap of the material, since more energy is required for an ionizing collision. Also, the peak electric field within W increases with increased doping
on the more lightly doped side of the junction. Therefore, Vbr decreases as
the doping increases, as Fig. 5–22 indicates.Junctions 225
5.4.3 rectifiers
The most obvious property of a p-n junction is its unilateral nature; that is,
to a good approximation it conducts current in only one direction. We can
think of an ideal diode as a short circuit when forward biased and as an open
circuit when reverse biased (Fig. 5–23a). The p-n junction diode does not
quite fit this description, but the I–V characteristics of many junctions can be
approximated by the ideal diode in series with other circuit elements to form
an equivalent circuit. For example, most forward-biased diodes exhibit an
offset voltage E0 (see Fig. 5–33), which can be approximated in a circuit model

by a battery in series with the ideal diode (Fig. 5–23b). The series battery in
the model keeps the ideal diode turned off for applied voltages less than E0.
From Section 5.6.1 we expect E0 to be approximately the contact potential
of the junction. In some cases the approximation to the actual diode characteristic is improved by adding a series resistor R to the circuit equivalent
(Fig. 5–23c). The equivalent circuit approximations illustrated in Fig. 5–23 are
called piecewise-linear equivalents, since the approximate characteristics are
linear over specific ranges of voltage and current.
An ideal diode can be placed in series with an a-c voltage source to
provide rectification of the signal. Since current can flow only in the forward
direction through the diode, only the positive half-cycles of the input sine
wave are passed. The output voltage is a half-rectified sine wave. Whereas the
input sinusoid has zero average value, the rectified signal has a positive average value and therefore contains a d-c component. By appropriate filtering,
this d-c level can be extracted from the rectified signal.
The unilateral nature of diodes is useful for many other circuit applications that require waveshaping. This involves alteration of a-c signals by
passing only certain portions of the signal while blocking other portions.
Junction diodes designed for use as rectifiers should have I–V characteristics as close as possible to that of the ideal diode. The reverse current
should be negligible, and the forward current should exhibit little voltage
dependence (negligible forward resistance R). The reverse breakdown voltage should be large, and the offset voltage E0 in the forward direction should
be small. Unfortunately, not all of these requirements can be met by a single
device; compromises must be made in the design of the junction to provide
the best diode for the intended application.
From the theory derived in Section 5.3 we can easily list the various
requirements for good rectifier junctions. Band gap is obviously an important consideration in choosing a material for rectifier diodes. Since ni is small
for large band gap materials, the reverse saturation current (which depends
on thermally generated carriers) decreases with increasing Eg. A rectifier
made with a wide band gap material can be operated at higher temperatures, because thermal excitation of EHPs is reduced by the increased band
gap. Such temperature effects are critically important in rectifiers, which
must carry large currents in the forward direction and are thereby subjected
to appreciable heating. On the other hand, the contact potential and offset
voltage E0 generally increase with Eg. This drawback is usually outweighed
by the advantages of low ni; for example, Si is generally preferred over Ge
for power rectifiers because of its wider band gap, lower leakage current,
and higher breakdown voltage, as well as its more convenient fabrication
properties.
The doping concentration on each side of the junction influences the
avalanche breakdown voltage, the contact potential, and the series resistance
of the diode. If the junction has one highly doped side and one lightly doped
side (such as a p+-n junction), the lightly doped region determines many of
the properties of the junction. From Fig. 5–22 we see that a high-resistivityJunctions 227
region should be used for at least one side of the junction to increase the
breakdown voltage Vbr. However, this approach tends to increase the forward resistance R of Fig. 5–23c, and therefore contributes to the problems
of thermal effects due to I2R heating. To reduce the resistance of the lightly
doped region, it is necessary to make its area large and reduce its length.
Therefore, the physical geometry of the diode is another important design
variable. Limitations on the practical area for a diode include problems of
obtaining uniform starting material and junction processing over large areas.
Localized flaws in junction uniformity can cause premature reverse breakdown in a small region of the device. Similarly, the lightly doped region of
the junction cannot be made arbitrarily short. One of the primary problems
with a short, lightly doped region is an effect called punch-through. Since the
transition region width W increases with reverse bias and extends primarily
into the lightly doped region, it is possible for W to increase until it fills the
entire length of this region (Prob. 5.30). The result of punch-through is a
breakdown below the value of Vbr expected from Fig. 5–22.
In devices designed for use at high reverse bias, care must be taken to
avoid premature breakdown across the edge of the sample. This effect can
be reduced by beveling the edge or by diffusing a guard ring to isolate the
junction from the edge of the sample (Fig. 5–24). The electric field is lower at
the beveled edge of the sample in Fig. 5–24b than it is in the main body of the
device. Similarly, the junction at the lightly doped p guard ring of Fig. 5–24c
breaks down at higher voltage than the p+-n junction. Since the depletion
region is wider in the p ring than in the p+ region, the average electric field
is smaller at the ring for a given diode reverse voltage.
In fabricating a p+-n or a p@n+ junction, it is common to terminate the
lightly doped region with a heavily doped layer of the same type (Fig. 5–25a),
to ease the problem of making ohmic contact to the device. The result is
a p+@n@n+ structure with the p@n+ layer serving as the active junction, or a
p+@n@n+ device with an active p@n+ junction. The lightly doped center region
determines the avalanche breakdown voltage. If this region is short compared with the minority carrier diffusion length, the excess carrier injection
for large forward currents can increase the conductivity of the region significantly. This type of conductivity modulation, which reduces the forward
resistance R, can be very useful for high-current devices. On the other hand,

a short, lightly doped center region can also lead to punch-through under
reverse bias, as in Fig. 5–25c.
The mounting of a rectifier junction is critical to its ability to handle
power. For diodes used in low-power circuits, glass or plastic encapsulation
or a simple header mounting is adequate. However, high-current devices
that must dissipate large amounts of heat require special mountings to transfer thermal energy away from the junction. A typical Si power rectifier is
mounted on a molybdenum or tungsten disk to match the thermal expansion properties of the Si. This disk is fastened to a large stud of copper or
other thermally conductive material that can be bolted to a heat sink with
appropriate cooling.
5.4.4 the breakdown Diode
As we discussed earlier in this section, the reverse-bias breakdown voltage
of a junction can be varied by choice of junction doping concentrations. The
breakdown mechanism is the Zener effect (tunneling) for abrupt junctions
with extremely heavy doping; however, the more common breakdown is
avalanche (impact ionization), typical of more lightly doped or graded junctions. By varying the doping we can fabricate diodes with specific breakdown
voltages ranging from less than one volt to several hundred volts. If the junction is well designed, the breakdown will be sharp and the current after
breakdown will be essentially independent of voltage (Fig. 5–26a). When a
diode is designed for a specific breakdown voltage, it is called a breakdown
diode. Such diodes are also called Zener diodes, despite the fact that the
actual breakdown mechanism is usually the avalanche effect. This error in
terminology is due to an early mistake in identifying the first observations
of breakdown in p-n junctions.
Breakdown diodes can be used as voltage regulators in circuits with
varying inputs. The 15-V breakdown diode of Fig. 5–26 holds the circuit output voltage v0 constant at 15 V, while the input varies at voltages greater
than 15 V. For example, if vs is a rectified and filtered signal composed of a
17-V d-c component and a 1-V ripple variation above and below 17 V, the

output v0 will remain constant at 15 V. More complicated voltage regulator
circuits can be designed using breakdown diodes, depending on the type of
signal being regulated and the nature of the output load. In a similar application, such a device can be used as a reference diode; since the breakdown voltage of a particular diode is known, the voltage across it during breakdown
can be used as a reference in circuits that require a known value of voltage.

We have considered the properties of p-n junctions under equilibrium conditions and with steady state current flow. Most of the basic concepts of junction devices can be obtained from these properties, except for the important
behavior of junctions under transient or a-c conditions. Since most solid
state devices are used for switching or for processing a-c signals, we cannot claim to understand p-n junctions without knowing at least the basics
of time-dependent processes. Unfortunately, a complete analysis of these
effects involves more mathematical manipulation than is appropriate for an
introductory discussion. Basically, the problem involves solving the various
current flow equations in two simultaneous variables, space and time. We can,
however, obtain the basic results for several special cases which represent
typical time-dependent applications of junction devices.
In this section we investigate the important influence of excess carriers
in transient and a-c problems. The switching of a diode from its forward state
to its reverse state is analyzed to illustrate a typical transient problem. Finally,
these concepts are applied to the case of small a-c signals to determine the
equivalent capacitance of a p-n junction.
5.5.1 time variation of stored charge
Another look at the excess carrier distributions of a p-n junction under bias
(e.g., Fig. 5–15) tells us that any change in current must lead to a change of
charge stored in the carrier distributions. Since time is required in building
5.5
transient anD
a-c cOnDitiOns230 Chapter 5
up or depleting a charge distribution, however, the stored charge must inevitably lag behind the current in a time-dependent problem. This is inherently
a capacitive effect, as we shall see in Section 5.5.4.
For a proper solution of a transient problem, we must use the timedependent continuity equations, Eqs. (4–31). We can obtain each component
of the current at position x and time t from these equations; for example,
from Eq. (4–31a) we can write
-
0J
p(x, t)
0x
= q
dp(x, t)
v
p
+ q
0p(x, t)
0t
(5–45)
To obtain the instantaneous current density, we can integrate both sides
at time t to obtain
Jp
(0) - Jp(x) = q L0 xc dp(vxp, t) + p(x0,t t) d dx (5–46)
For injection into a long n region from a p+ region, we can take the
current at x
n = 0 to be all hole current, and Jpat xn = ∞ to be zero. Then
the total injected current, including time variations, is
i(t) = ip(xn = 0, t) =
qA

i(t) =
Qp(t)
v
p
+
dQp(t)
dt (5–47)
This result indicates that the hole current injected across the p+-n
junction (and therefore approximately the total diode current) is determined
by two charge storage effects: (1) the usual recombination term Qp/tp in
which the excess carrier distribution is replaced every tp seconds, and (2) a
charge buildup (or depletion) term dQp>dt, which allows for the fact that
the distribution of excess carriers can be increasing or decreasing in a timedependent problem. For steady state the dQp>dt term is zero, and Eq. (5–47)
reduces to Eq. (5–40), as expected. In fact, we could have written Eq. (5–47)
intuitively rather than having obtained it from the continuity equation, since
it is reasonable that the hole current injected at any given time must supply
minority carriers for recombination and for whatever variations that occur
in the total stored charge.
We can solve for the stored charge as a function of time for a given
current transient. For example, the step turn-off transient (Fig. 5–27a), in
which a current I is suddenly removed at t = 0, leaves the diode with stored
charge. Since the excess holes in the n region must die out by recombination with the matching excess electron population, some time is required
for Qp(t) to reach zero. Solving Eq. (5–47) with Laplace transforms, with
i(t 7 0) = 0 and Qp(0) = Ivp, we obtainJunctions 231
0 =
1vp
Qp(s) + sQp(s) - Ivp
Qp(s) =
Iv
p
s + 1 > vp
Qp(t) = Ivpe-t>vp (5–48)
As expected, the stored charge dies out exponentially from its initial value
Iv
p with a time constant equal to the hole lifetime in the n material.
An important implication of Fig. 5–27 is that even though the current is suddenly terminated, the voltage across the junction persists until Qp
disappears. Since the excess hole concentration can be related to junction
voltage by formulas derived in Section 5.3.2, we can presumably solve for
v(t). We already know that at any time during the transient, the excess hole
concentration at x
n = 0 is
∆pn(t) = pn(eqv(t)>kT - 1) (5–49)
so that finding ∆pn(t) will easily give us the transient voltage. Unfortunately,
it is not simple to obtain ∆pn(t) exactly from our expression for Qp(t). The
problem is that the hole distribution does not remain in the convenient
exponential form it has in steady state. As Fig. 5–27c suggests, the quantity
dp(xn, t) becomes markedly nonexponential as the transient proceeds. For
example, since the injected hole current is proportional to the gradient of the
hole distribution at x
n = 0 (Fig. 5–16a), zero current implies zero gradient.
Thus the slope of the distribution must be exactly zero at xn = 0 throughout
the transient.13 This zero slope at the point of injection distorts the exponential distribution, particularly in the region near the junction. As time
progresses in Fig. 5–27c, dp (and therefore dn) decreases as the excess electrons and holes recombine. To find the exact expression for dp(xn, t) during
the transient would require a rather difficult solution of the time-dependent
continuity equation.

13We notice that, while the magnitude of dp cannot change instantaneously, the slope must go to zero
immediately. This can occur in a small region near the junction with negligible redistribution of charge at t = 0.232 Chapter 5
An approximate solution for v(t) can be obtained by assuming an exponential distribution for dp at every instant during the decay. This type of
quasi-steady state approximation neglects distortion due to the slope requirement at x
n = 0 and the effects of diffusion during the transient. Thus we
would expect the calculation to give rather crude results. On the other hand,
such a solution can give us a feeling for the variation of junction voltage
during the transient. If we take
dp(xn, t) = ∆pn(t)e-xn>Lp (5–50)
we have for the stored charge at any instant
Qp(t) = qA L0 ∞ ∆pn(t)e-xn>Lpdxn = qALp∆pn(t) (5–51)
Relating ∆pn(t) to v(t) by Eq. (5–49) we have
∆pn(t) = pn(eqn(t)>kT - 1) =
Qp(t)
qALp (5–52)
Thus in the quasi-steady state approximation, the junction voltage varies according to
v(t) = kT
q
ln aqAL Itpppne-t>tp + 1b (5–53)
during the turn-off transient of Fig. 5–27. This analysis, while not accurate in
its details, does indicate clearly that the voltage across a p-n junction cannot
be changed instantaneously, and that stored charge can present a problem
in a diode intended for switching applications.
Many of the problems of stored charge can be reduced by designing
a p+-n diode (for example) with a very narrow n region. If the n region is
shorter than a hole diffusion length, very little charge is stored. Thus, little
time is required to switch the diode on and off. This type of structure, called
the narrow base diode, is considered in Prob. 5.40. The switching process can
be made still faster by purposely adding recombination centers, such as Au
atoms in Si, to increase the recombination rate.
5.5.2 reverse recovery transient
In most switching applications a diode is switched from forward conduction to a reverse-biased state, and vice versa. The resulting stored charge
transient is somewhat more complicated than for a simple turn-off transient,
and therefore it requires slightly more analysis. An important result of this
example is that a reverse current much larger than the normal reverse saturation current can flow in a junction during the time required for readjustment
of the stored charge.Junctions 233
Let us assume a p+-n junction is driven by a square wave generator
that periodically switches from +E to -E volts (Fig. 5–28a). While E is
positive the diode is forward biased, and in steady state the current If flows
through the junction. If E is much larger than the small forward voltage of
the junction, the source voltage appears almost entirely across the resistor,

and the current is approximately i = If ≃ E>R. After the generator voltage is reversed (t 7 0), the current must initially reverse to i = Ir≃ -E>R.
The reason for this unusually large reverse current through the diode is
that the stored charge (and hence the junction voltage) cannot be changed
instantaneously. Therefore, just as the current is reversed, the junction voltage remains at the small forward-bias value it had before t = 0. A voltage
loop equation then tells us that the large reverse current -E>R must flow
temporarily. While the current is negative through the junction, the slope of
the dp(xn) distribution must be positive at xn = 0.
As the stored charge is depleted from the neighborhood of the junction (Fig. 5–28b), we can find the junction voltage again from Eq. (5–49). As
long as ∆pn is positive, the junction voltage v(t) is positive and small; thus
i≃ -E>R until ∆pn goes to zero. When the stored charge is depleted and
∆pn becomes negative, the junction exhibits a negative voltage. Since the
reverse-bias voltage of a junction can be large, the source voltage begins to
divide between R and the junction. As time proceeds, the magnitude of the
reverse current becomes smaller as more of -E appears across the reversebiased junction, until finally the only current is the small reverse saturation
current which is characteristic of the diode. The time tsd required for the
stored charge (and therefore the junction voltage) to become zero is called
the storage delay time. This delay time is an important figure of merit in
evaluating diodes for switching applications. It is usually desirable that tsd
be small compared with the switching times required (Fig. 5–29). The critical parameter determining tsd is the carrier lifetime (tp for the example of
the p+-n junction). Since the recombination rate determines the speed with
which excess holes can disappear from the n region, we would expect tsd to

be proportional to tp. In fact, an exact analysis of the problem of Fig. 5–28
leads to the result
tsd = vpc erf -1aIf +If Ir b d 2 (5–54)
where the error function (erf) is a tabulated function. Although the exact
solution leading to Eq. (5–54) is too lengthy for us to consider here, an
approximate result can be obtained from the quasi-steady state assumption.
Assume a p+-n diode is biased in the forward direction, with a current If. exaMPle 5–5
At time t = 0 the current is switched to -I

An important result of Eq. (5–54) is that tp can be calculated in a
straightforward way from a measurement of storage delay time. In fact,
measurement of tsd from an experimental arrangement such as Fig. 5–28a
is a common method of measuring lifetimes. In some cases this is a more236 Chapter 5
convenient technique than the photoconductive decay measurement discussed in Section 4.3.2.
As in the case of the turn-off transient of the previous section, the storage delay time can be reduced by introducing recombination centers into the
diode material, thus reducing the carrier lifetimes, or by utilizing the narrow
base diode configuration.
5.5.3 switching Diodes
In discussing rectifiers we emphasized the importance of minimizing the
reverse-bias current and the power losses under forward bias. In many applications, time response can be important as well. If a junction diode is to be
used to switch rapidly from the conducting to the nonconducting state and
back again, special consideration must be given to its charge control properties. We have discussed the equations governing the turn-on time and the
reverse recovery time of a junction. From Eqs. (5–47) and (5–54) it is clear
that a diode with fast switching properties must either store very little charge
in the neutral regions for steady forward currents or have a very short carrier
lifetime, or both.
As mentioned above, we can improve the switching speed of a diode by
adding efficient recombination centers to the bulk material. For Si diodes, Au
doping is useful for this purpose. To a good approximation the carrier lifetime
varies with the reciprocal of the recombination center concentration. Thus, for
example, a p+-n Si diode may have vp = 1 os and a reverse recovery time of
0.1 os before Au doping. If the addition of 1014 Au atoms/cm3 reduces the lifetime to 0.1 os and tsd to 0.01 os, 1015 cm - 3 Au atoms could reduce vp to 0.01 os
and tsd to 1 ns (10 - 9 s). This process cannot be continued indefinitely, however.
The reverse current due to generation of carriers from the Au centers in the
depletion region becomes appreciable with large Au concentration (Section
5.6.2). In addition, as the Au concentration approaches the lightest doping of the
junction, the equilibrium carrier concentration of that region can be affected.
A second approach to improving the diode switching time is to make
the lightly doped neutral region shorter than a minority carrier diffusion
length. This is the narrow base diode (Prob. 5.40). In this case the stored
charge for forward conduction is very small, since most of the injected carriers diffuse through the lightly doped region to the end contact. When such
a diode is switched to reverse conduction, very little time is required to
eliminate the stored charge in the narrow neutral region. The mathematics
involved in Prob. 5.40 is particularly interesting, because it closely resembles
the calculations we shall make in analyzing the bipolar junction transistor
in Chapter 7.
5.5.4 capacitance of p-n Junctions
There are basically two types of capacitance associated with a junction:
(1) the junction capacitance due to the dipole in the transition region andJunctions 237
(2) the charge storage capacitance arising from the lagging behind of voltage
as current changes, due to charge storage effects.14 Both of these capacitances
are important, and they must be considered in designing p-n junction devices
for use with time-varying signals. The junction capacitance (1) is dominant
under reverse-bias conditions, and the charge storage capacitance (2) is
dominant when the junction is forward biased. In many applications of p-n
junctions, the capacitance is a limiting factor in the usefulness of the device;
on the other hand, there are important applications in which the capacitance
discussed here can be useful in circuit applications and in providing important information about the structure of the p-n junction.
The junction capacitance of a diode is easy to visualize from the charge
distribution in the transition region (Fig. 5–12). The uncompensated acceptor
ions on the p side provide a negative charge, and an equal positive charge
results from the ionized donors on the n side of the transition region. The
capacitance of the resulting dipole is slightly more difficult to calculate than
is the usual parallel plate capacitance, but we can obtain it in a few steps.
Instead of the common expression C = ∙ Q>V ∙ , which applies to
capacitors in which charge is a linear function of voltage, we must use the
more general definition
C = ` dQ dV ` (5–55)
since the charge Q on each side of the transition region varies nonlinearly
with the applied voltage (Fig. 5–30a). We can demonstrate this nonlinear
dependence by reviewing the equations for the width of the transition
region (W) and the resulting charge. The equilibrium value of W was found
in Eq. (5–21) to be
W = c 2PqV0aNNa a+NNd d b d 1>2 (equilibrium) (5–56)
Since we are dealing with the nonequilibrium case with voltage V
applied, we must use the altered value of the electrostatic potential barrier
(V0 - V), as discussed in relation to Fig. 5–13. The proper expression for the
width of the transition region is then
W = c 2P(V0q- V)aNNa a+NNd d b d 1>2 (with bias) (5–57)
In this expression the applied voltage V can be either positive or negative
to account for forward or reverse bias. As expected, the width of the transition region is increased for reverse bias and is decreased under forward bias.
14The capacitance (1) above is also referred to as the transition region capacitance or depletion layer
capacitance; (2) is often called the diffusion capacitance.238 Chapter 5
Since the uncompensated charge Q on each side of the junction varies with
the transition region width, variations in the applied voltage result in corresponding variations in the charge, as required for a capacitor. The value of
Q can be written in terms of the doping concentration and transition region
width on each side of the junction (Fig. 5–12):

and therefore the charge on each side of the dipole is

W = Ac 2qP(V0 - V)NNd d+NNa a d 1>2 (5–60)
Thus the charge is indeed a nonlinear function of applied voltage. From
this expression and the definition of capacitance in Eq. (5–55), we can calculate the junction capacitance Cj. Since the voltage that varies the charge
in the transition region is the barrier height (V0 - V), we must take the
derivative with respect to this potential difference:
Cj
= ` d(VdQ 0 - V) ` = A2 c (V02q-PV)NNd d+NNa a d 1>2 (5–61)
The quantity Cj is a voltage-variable capacitance, since Cj is proportional
to (V0 - V) - 1>2. There are several important applications for variable capacitors, including use in tuned circuits. The p-n junction device which makes use
of the voltage-variable properties of Cj is called a varactor. We shall discuss
this device further in Section 5.5.5.
Although the dipole charge is distributed in the transition region of the
junction, the form of the parallel plate capacitor formula is obtained from
the expressions for Cj and W (Fig. 5–30a):
Cj
= PAc 2P(V0q- V) NNd d+NNa a d 1>2 = PWA (5–62)
In analogy with the parallel plate capacitor, the transition region width W
corresponds with the plate separation of the conventional capacitor.
In the case of an asymmetrically doped junction, the transition region
extends primarily into the less heavily doped side, and the capacitance is
determined by only one of the doping concentrations (Fig. 5–30a). For a p+-n
junction, Na W Nd and xn0≃W, while xp0 is negligible. The capacitance is

It is therefore possible to obtain the doping concentration of the lightly
doped n region from a measurement of capacitance. For example, in a
reverse-biased junction the applied voltage V = -Vr can be made much240 Chapter 5
larger than the contact potential V0, so that the latter becomes negligible. If
the area of the junction can be measured, a reliable value of Nd results from
a measurement of C
j. However, these equations were obtained by assuming
a sharp step junction. Certain modifications must be made in the case of a
graded junction (Section 5.6.4 and Prob. 5.42).
The junction capacitance dominates the reactance of a p-n junction
under reverse bias; for forward bias, however, the charge storage, or diffusion
capacitance, Cs becomes dominant. It has been recently shown15 that the various time-dependent current components, as well as the boundary conditions,
affect the diffusion capacitance in forward bias. We need to specify at which
terminals the stored charges are extracted or “reclaimed” and where the
relevant voltage drops occur. For long diodes whose dimensions are larger
than the diffusion lengths, there is no diffusion capacitance. For a short diode,
the reclaimable charge is two-thirds of the total stored charge. The diffusion
capacitance due to stored holes on the n side of length c is:

There is a similar contribution from the stored electrons on the p side
(Fig. 5–31). In practice, most Si p-n junctions behave like short diodes, while
laser diodes made in direct band gap (short lifetime) semiconductors often
correspond to the long-diode case.
Similarly, we can determine the a-c conductance by allowing small
changes in the current. For example, for a long diode, we get

5.5.5 the varactor Diode
The term varactor is a shortened form of variable reactor, referring to the
voltage-variable capacitance of a reverse-biased p-n junction. The equations
derived in Section 5.5.4 indicate that junction capacitance depends on the
applied voltage and the design of the junction. In some cases a junction
with fixed reverse bias may be used as a capacitance of a set value. More
commonly the varactor diode is designed to exploit the voltage-variable
properties of the junction capacitance. For example, a varactor (or a set of
varactors) may be used in the tuning stage of a radio receiver to replace the
bulky variable plate capacitor. The size of the resulting circuit can be greatly
reduced, and its dependability is improved. Other applications of varactors
include use in harmonic generation, microwave frequency multiplication,
and active filters.
If the p-n junction is abrupt, the capacitance varies as the square root
of the reverse bias V
r [Eq. (5–61)]. In a graded junction, however, the capacitance can usually be written in the form
Cj
∝ V -n
r for Vr W V0 (5–66)
For example, in a linearly graded junction the exponent n is one-third
(Prob. 5.42). Thus the voltage sensitivity of Cj is greater for an abrupt junction than for a linearly graded junction. For this reason, varactor diodes
are often made by epitaxial growth techniques, or by ion implantation. The
epitaxial layer and the substrate doping profile can be designed to obtain
junctions for which the exponent n in Eq. (5–66) is greater than one-half.
Such junctions are called hyperabrupt junctions.
In the set of doping profiles shown in Fig. 5–32, the junction is assumed
p+-n so that the depletion layer width W extends primarily into the n side.
Three types of doping profiles on the n side are illustrated, with the donor
distribution Nd(x) given by Gxm, where G is a constant and the exponent m
is 0, 1, or - 3 2. We can show (Prob. 5.42) that the exponent n in Eq. (5–66) is
1/(m + 2) for the p+-n junction. Thus for the profiles of Fig. 5–32, n is 1 2 for
the abrupt junction and 1 3 for the linearly graded junction. The hyperabrupt

Because of the wide variety of Cj vs. Vr dependencies available by
choosing doping profiles, varactor diodes can be designed for specific applications. For some high-frequency applications, varactors can be designed to
exploit the forward-bias charge storage capacitance in short diodes.
The approach we have taken in studying p-n junctions has focused on the
basic principles of operation, neglecting secondary effects. This allows for a
relatively uncluttered view of carrier injection and other junction properties,
and illuminates the essential features of diode operation. To complete the
description, however, we must now fill in a few details which can affect the
operation of junction devices under special circumstances.
Most of the deviations from the simple theory can be treated by fairly
straightforward modifications of the basic equations. In this section we shall
investigate the most important deviations and alter the theory wherever possible. In a few cases, we shall simply indicate the approach to be taken and
the result. The most important alterations to the simple diode theory are the
effects of contact potential and changes in majority carrier concentration on
carrier injection, recombination and generation within the transition region,
ohmic effects, and the effects of graded junctions.

5.6.1 effects of contact Potential on carrier injection
If the forward-bias I–V characteristics of various semiconductor diodes are
compared, it becomes clear that the band gap has an important influence
on carrier injection. For example, Fig. 5–33 compares the low-temperature
characteristics of heavily doped diodes having various band gaps. One obvious feature of this figure is that the I–V characteristics appear “square”; that
is, the current is very small until a critical forward bias is reached, and then
the current increases rapidly. This is typical of exponentials plotted on such
a scale. However, it is significant that the limiting voltage is slightly less than
the value of the band gap in electron volts.
The reason for the small current at low voltages for these devices can
be understood from a simple rearrangement of the diode equation. If we
rewrite Eq. (5–36) for a forward-biased p+-n diode (with V ⪢ kT/q) and
include the exponential form for the minority carrier concentration pn, we
obtain

qADp
L

pneqV>kT =

L
p
Nv
e[qV - (EFn - Evn)]>kT (5–68)
Hole injection into the n material is small if the forward bias V is much
less than (EFn - Evn)>q. For a p+-n diode, this quantity is essentially the contact potential, since the Fermi level is near the valence band on the p side. If
the n region is also heavily doped, the contact potential is almost equal to the
band gap (Fig. 5–34). This accounts for the dramatic increase in diode current
near the band gap voltage in Fig. 5–33. Contributing to the small current at
lower voltages is the fact that the minority carrier concentration pn = n2 i > Nd
is very small at low temperature (ni small) and with heavy doping (Nd large).

The limiting forward bias across a p-n junction is equal to the contact
potential, as in Fig. 5–34b. This effect is not predicted by the simple diode
equation, for which the current increases exponentially with applied voltage. The reason this important result is excluded in the simple theory is that
in Eq. (5–28) we neglect changes in the majority carrier concentrations on
either side of the junction. This assumption is valid only for low injection
levels; for large injected carrier concentrations, the excess majority carriers
become important compared with the majority doping. For example, at low
injection ∆np = ∆pp is important compared with the equilibrium minority
electron concentration n
p, but is negligible compared with the majority hole
concentration pp; this was the basis for neglecting ∆pp in Eq. (5–28). For high
injection levels, however, ∆pp can be comparable to pp and we must write
Eq. (5–27) in the form
p(-xp0)
p(xn0) =
pp + ∆pp
pn + ∆pn = eq(V0 - V )>kT = nnn p + + ∆ ∆nnn p (5–69)
From Eq. (5–38), we get at either edge of the depletion region,
pn = p(-xp0)n(-xp0) = p(xn0)n(xn0) = n2 i e

For example, at -xpo we then get

Keeping in mind that ∆pp = ∆np, np V ∆np, and in high-level injection
pp 6 ∆pp, we approximately get

p = nie qV>2kT (5–72)
The rest of the derivation is very similar to that in Section 5.3.2. Hence, the

5.6.2 recombination and Generation in the transition region
In analyzing the p-n junction, we have assumed that recombination and thermal generation of carriers occur primarily in the neutral p and n regions, outside the transition region. In this model, forward current in the diode is carried
by recombination of excess minority carriers injected into each neutral region
by the junction. Similarly, the reverse saturation current is due to the thermal
generation of EHPs in the neutral regions and the subsequent diffusion of the
generated minority carriers to the transition region, where they are swept to
the other side by the field. In many devices this model is adequate; however,
a more complete description of junction operation should include recombination and generation within the transition region itself.
When a junction is forward biased, the transition region contains excess
carriers of both types, which are in transit from one side of the junction to
the other. Unless the width of the transition region W is very small compared
with the carrier diffusion lengths Ln and Lp, significant recombination can
take place within W. An accurate calculation of this recombination current
is complicated by the fact that the recombination rate, which depends on the
carrier concentrations [Eq. (4–5)], varies with position within the transition
region. Analysis of the recombination kinetics shows that the current due
to recombination within W is proportional to ni and increases with forward
bias according to approximately exp (qV>2kT). On the other hand, current
due to recombination in the neutral regions is proportional to pn and np
[Eq. (5–36)] and therefore to n2 i > Nd and n2 i > Na, and increases according to
exp (qV>kT). The diode equation can be modified to include this effect by
including the parameter n:
I = I′0(eqV>nkT - 1) (5–74)
where n varies between 1 and 2, depending on the material and temperature.
Since n determines the departure from the ideal diode characteristic, it is
often called the ideality factor.
The ratio of the two currents
I(recombination in neutral regions)
I(recombination in transition region) ∝
n2 i eqV>kT
nieqV>2kT ∝ nieqV>2kT (5–75)
becomes small for wide band gap materials, low temperatures (small ni), and
for low voltage. Thus the forward current for low injection in a Si diode is
likely to be dominated by recombination in the transition region, while a Ge
diode may follow the usual diode equation. In either case, injection through
W into the neutral regions becomes more important with increased voltage.
Therefore, n in Eq. (5–74) may vary from ∼2 at low voltage to ∼1 at higher
voltage.
Just as recombination within W can affect the forward characteristics,
the reverse current through a junction can be influenced by carrier generation in the transition region. We found in Section 5.3.3 that the reverse246 Chapter 5
saturation current can be accounted for by the thermal generation of EHPs
within a diffusion length of either side of the transition region. The generated minority carriers diffuse to the transition region, where they are swept
to the other side of the junction by the electric field (Fig. 5–35). However,
carrier generation can take place within the transition region itself. If W is
small compared with Ln or Lp, band-to-band generation of EHPs within the
transition region is not important compared with generation in the neutral
regions. However, the lack of free carriers within the space charge of the
transition region can create a current due to the net generation of carriers by
emission from recombination centers. Of the four generation–recombination
processes depicted in Fig. 5–36, the two capture rates Rn and Rp are negligible
within W because of the very small carrier concentrations in the reverse-bias
space charge region. Therefore, a recombination level Er near the center of
the band gap can provide carriers through the thermal generation rates Gn
and G
p. Each recombination center alternately emits an electron and a hole;
physically, this means that an electron at Er is thermally excited to the conduction band (Gn) and a valence band electron is subsequently excited thermally to the empty state on the recombination level, leaving a hole behind
in the valence band (Gp). The process can then be repeated over and over,
providing electrons for the conduction band and holes for the valence band.
Normally, these emission processes are exactly balanced by the corresponding capture processes Rn and Rp. However, in the reverse-bias transition
region, generated carriers are swept out before recombination can occur,
and net generation results.

Of course, the importance of thermal generation within W depends on
the temperature and the nature of the recombination centers. A level near
the middle of the band gap is most effective, since for such centers neither Gn
nor G
p requires thermal excitation of an electron over more than about half
the band gap. If no recombination level is available, this type of generation
is negligible. However, in most materials recombination centers exist near
the middle of the gap due to trace impurities or lattice defects. Generation
from centers within W is most important in materials with large band gaps,
for which band-to-band generation in the neutral regions is small. Thus for Si,
generation within W is generally more important than for a narrower band
gap material such as Ge.
The saturation current due to generation in the neutral regions was
found to be essentially independent of reverse bias. However, generation
within W naturally increases as W increases with reverse bias. As a result,
the reverse current can increase almost linearly with W, or with the square
root of reverse-bias voltage.
5.6.3 Ohmic losses
In deriving the diode equation we assumed that the voltage applied to the
device appears entirely across the junction. Thus we neglected any voltage
drop in the neutral regions or at the external contacts. For most devices this
is a valid assumption; the doping is usually fairly high, so that the resistivity of
each neutral region is low, and the area of a typical diode is large compared
with its length. However, some devices do exhibit ohmic effects, which cause
significant deviation from the expected I–V characteristic.
We can seldom represent ohmic losses in a diode accurately by including a simple resistance in series with the junction. The effects of voltage drops
outside the transition region are complicated by the fact that the voltage
drop depends on the current, which in turn is dictated by the voltage across

the junction. For example, if we represent the series resistance of the p and n
regions by Rp and Rn, respectively, we can write the junction voltage V as
V = V
a - I [Rp(I) + Rn(I)] (5–76)
where V
a is the external voltage applied to the device. As the current
increases, there is an increasing voltage drop in Rp and Rn, and the junction
voltage V decreases. This reduction in V lowers the level of injection so that
the current increases more slowly with increased bias. A further complication
in calculating the ohmic loss is that the conductivity of each neutral region
increases with increasing carrier injection. Since the effects of Eq. (5–76) are
most pronounced at high injection levels, this conductivity modulation by the
injected excess carriers can reduce Rp and Rn significantly.
Ohmic losses are purposely avoided in properly designed devices by
appropriate choices of doping and geometry. Therefore, deviations of the
current generally appear only for very high currents, outside the normal
operating range of the device.
Figure 5–37 shows the forward and reverse current–voltage characteristics of a p-n junction on a semilog scale, both for an ideal Shockley diode
as well as for non-ideal devices. For an ideal forward-biased diode, we get
a straight line on a semilog plot reflecting the exponential dependence of
current on voltage. On the other hand, taking into account all the secondorder effects discussed in Section 5.6, we see various regions of operation. At
low current levels, we see the enhanced generation–recombination current,
leading to a higher diode ideality factor (n = 2). For moderate currents, we
get ideal low-level injection and diffusion-limited current (n = 1). At higher
currents, we get high-level injection and n = 2, while at even higher currents,
the ohmic drops in the space charge neutral regions become important.
Similarly, in reverse bias, in an ideal diode, we have a constant, voltage-independent reverse saturation current. However, in actuality, we get an
enhanced, voltage-dependent generation–recombination leakage current. At
very high reverse biases, the diode breaks down reversibly due to avalanche
or Zener effects.
5.6.4 Graded Junctions
While the abrupt junction approximation accurately describes the properties of many epitaxially grown junctions, it is often inadequate in analyzing
diffused or implanted junction devices. For shallow diffusions, in which the
diffused impurity profile is very steep (Fig. 5–38a), the abrupt approximation
is usually acceptable. If the impurity profile is spread out into the sample,
however, a graded junction can result (Fig. 5–38b). Several of the expressions
we have derived for the abrupt junction must be modified for this case (see
Section 5.5.5).
The graded junction problem can be solved analytically if, for example,
we make a linear approximation of the net impurity distribution near theJunctions 249
junction (Fig. 5–38c). We assume that the graded region can be described
approximately by
Nd - Na = Gx (5–77)
where G is a grade constant giving the slope of the net impurity distribution.
In Poisson’s equation [Eq. (5–14)], the linear approximation becomes

electric field distribution is therefore parabolic. The expressions for contact
potential and junction capacitance are different from the abrupt junction
case (Fig. 5–39 and Prob. 5.42), since the electric field is no longer linear on
each side of the junction.
In a graded junction the usual depletion approximation is often inaccurate. If the grade constant G is small, the carrier concentrations (p-n) can
be important in Eq. (5–78). Similarly, the usual assumption of negligible
space charge outside the transition region is questionable for small G. It
would be more accurate to refer to the regions just outside the transition
region as quasi-neutral rather than neutral. Thus the edges of the transition
region are not sharp as Fig. 5–39 implies but are spread out in x. These effects

complicate calculations of junction properties, and a computer must be used
in solving the problem accurately.
Most of the conclusions we have made regarding carrier injection,
recombination and generation currents, and other properties are qualitatively
applicable to graded junctions, with some alterations in the functional form
of the resulting equations. Therefore, we can apply most of our basic concepts
of junction theory to reasonably graded junctions as long as we remember
that certain modifications should be made in accurate computations.
Many of the useful properties of a p-n junction can be achieved by simply
forming an appropriate metal–semiconductor contact. This approach is obviously attractive because of its simplicity of fabrication; also, as we shall see
in this section, metal–semiconductor junctions are particularly useful when
high-speed rectification is required. On the other hand, we also must be able
to form nonrectifying (ohmic) contacts to semiconductors. Therefore, this
section deals with both rectifying and ohmic contacts.
5.7.1 schottky barriers
In Section 2.2.1 we discussed the work function q≥m of a metal in a vacuum.
An energy of q≥m is required to remove an electron at the Fermi level to
the vacuum outside the metal. Typical values of ≥m for very clean surfaces
are 4.3 V for Al and 4.8 V for Au. When negative charges are brought near
the metal surface, positive (image) charges are induced in the metal. When
this image force is combined with an applied electric field, the effective work
function is somewhat reduced. Such barrier lowering is called the Schottky
effect, and this terminology is carried over to the discussion of potential barriers arising in metal–semiconductor contacts. Although the Schottky effect
is only a part of the explanation of metal–semiconductor contacts, rectifying
contacts are generally referred to as Schottky barrier diodes. In this section
we shall see how such barriers arise in metal–semiconductor contacts. First
we consider barriers in ideal metal–semiconductor junctions, and then in
Section 5.7.4 we will include effects which alter the barrier height.
When a metal with work function q≥m is brought in contact with a
semiconductor having a work function q≥s, charge transfer occurs until the
Fermi levels align at equilibrium (Fig. 5–40). For example, when Φm 7 Φs,
the semiconductor Fermi level is initially higher than that of the metal before
contact is made. To align the two Fermi levels, the electrostatic potential of
the semiconductor must be raised (i.e., the electron energies must be lowered) relative to that of the metal. In the n-type semiconductor of Fig. 5–40
a depletion region W is formed near the junction. The positive charge due
to uncompensated donor ions within W matches the negative charge on the
metal. The electric field and the bending of the bands within W are similar
to effects already discussed for p-n junctions. For example, the depletion
width W in the semiconductor can be calculated from Eq. (5–21) by using

the p+-n approximation (i.e., by assuming the negative charge in the dipole
as a thin sheet of charge to the left of the junction). Similarly, the junction
capacitance is APs/W, as in the p+-n junction.17
The equilibrium contact potential V0, which prevents further net electron diffusion from the semiconductor conduction band into the metal, is the
difference in work function potentials Φm - Φs. The potential barrier height
ΦB for electron injection from the metal into the semiconductor conduction
band is Φ
m-x, where qx (called the electron affinity) is measured from the
vacuum level to the semiconductor conduction band edge. The equilibrium
potential difference V0 can be decreased or increased by the application of
either forward- or reverse-bias voltage, as in the p-n junction.
Figure 5–41 illustrates a Schottky barrier on a p-type semiconductor,
with Φ
m 6 Φs. In this case aligning the Fermi levels at equilibrium requires
a positive charge on the metal side and a negative charge on the semiconductor side of the junction. The negative charge is accommodated by a depletion
region W in which ionized acceptors (Na-) are left uncompensated by holes.
The potential barrier V0 retarding hole diffusion from the semiconductor to
the metal is Φ
s - Φm, and as before this barrier can be raised or lowered

17While the properties of the Schottky barrier depletion region are similar to those of the p+-n region, it is
clear that the analogy does not include forward-bias hole injection, which is dominant for the p+-n region,
but not for the contact of Fig. 5–40.Junctions 253
by the application of voltage across the junction. In visualizing the barrier
for holes, we recall from Fig. 5–11 that the electrostatic potential barrier for
positive charge is opposite to the barrier on the electron energy diagram.
The two other cases of ideal metal–semiconductor contacts (Φm 6 Φs
for n-type semiconductors, and Φm 7 Φs for p-type) result in nonrectifying
contacts. We will save treatment of these cases for Section 5.7.3, where ohmic
contacts are discussed.
5.7.2 rectifying contacts
When a forward-bias voltage V is applied to the Schottky barrier of Fig. 5–40b,
the contact potential is reduced from V0 to V0 - V (Fig. 5–42a). As a result,
electrons in the semiconductor conduction band can diffuse across the depletion region to the metal. This gives rise to a forward current (metal to semiconductor) through the junction. Conversely, a reverse bias increases the
barrier to V0 + Vr, and electron flow from semiconductor to metal becomes
negligible. In either case flow of electrons from the metal to the semiconductor is retarded by the barrier Φm - x. The resulting diode equation is similar
in form to that of the p-n junction
I = I0(eqV>kT - 1) (5–79)
as Fig. 5–42c suggests. In this case the reverse saturation current I0 is not
simply derived as it was for the p-n junction. One important feature we can

predict intuitively, however, is that the saturation current should depend
upon the size of the barrier ≥B for electron injection from the metal into the
semiconductor. This barrier (which is Φm - x for the ideal case shown in
Fig. 5–42) is unaffected by the bias voltage. We expect the probability of an
electron in the metal surmounting this barrier to be given by a Boltzmann
factor. Thus
I0
∝ e-qΦB>kT (5–80)
The diode equation (5–79) applies also to the metal–p-type semiconductor junction of Fig. 5–41. In this case forward voltage is defined with the
semiconductor biased positively with respect to the metal. Forward current
increases as this voltage lowers the potential barrier to V0 - V and holes flow
from the semiconductor to the metal. Of course, a reverse voltage increases
the barrier for hole flow and the current becomes negligible.
In both of these cases the Schottky barrier diode is rectifying, with
easy current flow in the forward direction and little current in the reverse
direction. We also note that the forward current in each case is due to the

injection of majority carriers from the semiconductor into the metal. The
absence of minority carrier injection and the associated storage delay time
is an important feature of Schottky barrier diodes. Although some minority
carrier injection occurs at high current levels, these are essentially majority carrier devices. Their high-frequency properties and switching speed are
therefore generally better than typical p-n junctions.
In the early days of semiconductor technology, rectifying contacts were
made simply by pressing a wire against the surface of the semiconductor.
In modern devices, however, the metal–semiconductor contact is made by
depositing an appropriate metal film on a clean semiconductor surface and
defining the contact pattern photolithographically. Schottky barrier devices
are particularly well suited for use in densely packed integrated circuits,
because fewer photolithographic masking steps are required compared to
p-n junction devices.
5.7.3 Ohmic contacts
In many cases we wish to have an ohmic metal–semiconductor contact, having a linear I–V characteristic in both biasing directions. For example, the
surface of a typical integrated circuit is a maze of p and n regions, which must
be contacted and interconnected. It is important that such contacts be ohmic,
with minimal resistance and no tendency to rectify signals.
Ideal metal–semiconductor contacts are ohmic when the charge
induced in the semiconductor in aligning the Fermi levels is provided by
majority carriers (Fig. 5–43). For example, in the Φm 6 Φs (n-type) case
of Fig. 5–43a, the Fermi levels are aligned at equilibrium by transferring
electrons from the metal to the semiconductor. This raises the semiconductor electron energies (lowers the electrostatic potential) relative to the
metal at equilibrium (Fig. 5–43b). In this case the barrier to electron flow
between the metal and the semiconductor is small and easily overcome
by a small voltage. Similarly, the case Φm 7 Φs (p-type) results in easy
hole flow across the junction (Fig. 5–43d). Unlike the rectifying contacts
discussed previously, no depletion region occurs in the semiconductor in
these cases since the electrostatic potential difference required to align the
Fermi levels at equilibrium calls for accumulation of majority carriers in
the semiconductor.
A practical method for forming ohmic contacts is by doping the
semiconductor heavily in the contact region. Thus if a barrier exists at the
interface, the depletion width is small enough to allow carriers to tunnel
through the barrier. For example, Au containing a small percentage of Sb
can be alloyed to n-type Si, forming an n+ layer at the semiconductor surface and an excellent ohmic contact. Similarly, p-type material requires a
p+ surface layer in contact with the metal. In the case of Al on p-type Si,
the metal contact also provides the acceptor dopant. Thus the required p+
surface layer is formed during a brief heat treatment of the contact after
the Al is deposited.256 Chapter 5

5.7.4 typical schottky barriers
The discussion of ideal metal–semiconductor contacts does not include certain effects of the junction between the two dissimilar materials. Unlike a
p-n junction, which occurs within a single crystal, a Schottky barrier junction includes a termination of the semiconductor crystal. The semiconductor surface contains surface states due to incomplete covalent bonds and
other effects, which can lead to charges at the metal–semiconductor interface. Furthermore, the contact is seldom an atomically sharp discontinuity
between the semiconductor crystal and the metal. There is typically a thin
interfacial layer, which is neither semiconductor nor metal. For example,
silicon crystals are covered by a thin (10-20 Å) oxide layer even after etching or cleaving in atmospheric conditions. Therefore, deposition of a metal
on such a Si surface leaves a glassy interfacial layer at the junction. Although
electrons can tunnel through this thin layer, it does affect the barrier to current transport through the junction.
Because of surface states, the interfacial layer, microscopic clusters
of metal–semiconductor phases, and other effects, it is difficult to fabricate
junctions with barriers near the ideal values predicted from the work functions of the two isolated materials. Therefore, measured barrier heights are
used in device design. In compound semiconductors the interfacial layer
introduces states in the semiconductor band gap that pin the Fermi level
at a fixed position, regardless of the metal used (Fig. 5–44). For example,
a collection of interface states located 0.7∼0.9 eV below the conduction
band pins EF at the surface of n-type GaAs, and the Schottky barrier height
is determined from this pinning effect rather than by the work function of
the metal. An interesting case is n-type InAs (Fig. 5–44b), in which EF at
the interface is pinned above the conduction band edge. As a result, ohmic

an excellent ohmic contact.258 Chapter 5
contact to n-type InAs can be made by depositing virtually any metal on
the surface. For Si, good Schottky barriers are formed by various metals,
such as Au or Pt. In the case of Pt, heat treatment results in a platinum
silicide layer, which provides a reliable Schottky barrier with ΦB ≃ 0.85 V
on n-type Si.
A full treatment of Schottky barrier diodes results in a forward current
equation of the form
I = ABT 2e-qΦB>kTeqV>nkT (5–81)
where B is a constant containing parameters of the junction properties and n
is a number between 1 and 2, similar to the ideality factor in Eq. (5–74) but
arising from different reasons. The mathematics of this derivation is similar
to that of thermionic emission, and the factor B corresponds to an effective
Richardson constant in the thermionic problem.
Thus far we have discussed p-n junctions formed within a single semiconductor (homojunctions) and junctions between a metal and a semiconductor. The third important class of junctions consist of those between
two lattice-matched semiconductors with different band gaps (heterojunctions). We discussed lattice-matching in Section 1.4.1. The interface
between two such semiconductors may be virtually free of defects, and
continuous crystals containing single or multiple heterojunctions can be
formed. The availability of heterojunctions and multilayer structures in
compound semiconductors opens a broad range of possibilities for device
development. We will discuss many of these applications in later chapters,
including heterojunction bipolar transistors, field-effect transistors, and
semiconductor lasers.
When semiconductors of different band gaps, work functions, and
electron affinities are brought together to form a junction, we expect discontinuities in the energy bands as the Fermi levels line up at equilibrium (Fig. 5–45). The discontinuities in the conduction band ∆Ec and the
valence band ∆E
v accommodate the difference in band gap between the
two semiconductors ∆E
g. In an ideal case, ∆Ec would be the difference in
electron affinities q(x2 - x1), and ∆Ev would be found from ∆Eg - ∆Ec .
This is known as the Anderson affinity rule. In practice, the band discontinuities are found experimentally for particular semiconductor pairs.
For example, in the commonly used system GaAs–AlGaAs (see Figs. 3–6
and 3–13), the direct band gap difference ∆EΓ g between the wider band
gap AlGaAs and the narrower band gap GaAs is apportioned approximately 2 3 in the conduction band and 1 3 in the valence band for the heterojunction. The built-in contact potential is divided between the two
5.8
heterOJunctiOnsJunctions 259
semiconductors as required to align the Fermi levels at equilibrium. The
resulting depletion region on each side of the heterojunction and the
amount of built-in potential on each side (making up the contact potential V0) are found by solving Poisson’s equation with the boundary condition of continuous electric flux density, P1ℰ1 = P2ℰ2 at the junction. The
barrier that electrons must overcome in moving from the n side to the
p side may be quite different from the barrier for holes moving from p
to n. The depletion region on each side is analogous to that described in

Eq. (5–23), except that we must account for the different dielectric constants in the two semiconductors.
To draw the band diagram for any semiconductor device involving
homojunctions or heterojunctions, we need material parameters such as
the band gap and the electron affinity which depend on the semiconductor
material but not on the doping, and the work function which depends on the
semiconductor as well as the doping. The electron affinity and work function are referenced to the vacuum level. The true vacuum level (or global
vacuum level), Evac, is the potential energy reference when an electron is
taken out of the semiconductor to infinity, where it sees no forces. Hence,
the true vacuum level is a constant (Fig. 5–45). That introduces an apparent
contradiction, however, because looking at the band bending in a semiconductor device, it seems to imply that the electron affinity in the semiconductor changes as a function of position, which is impossible because the
electron affinity is a material parameter. Therefore, we need to introduce
the new concept of the local vacuum level, Evac (loc), which varies along
with and parallel to the conduction band edge, thereby keeping the electron affinity constant. The local vacuum level tracks the potential energy
of an electron if it is moved just outside of the semiconductor, but not far
away. The difference between the local and global vacuum levels is due to
the electrical work done against the fringing electric fields of the depletion
region, and is equal to the potential energy qV0 due to the built-in contact
potential V0 in equilibrium. This potential energy can, of course, be modified
by an applied bias.
To draw the band diagram for a heterojunction accurately, we must
not only use the proper values for the band discontinuities but also account
for the band bending in the junction. To do this, we must solve Poisson’s
equation across the heterojunction, taking into account the details of doping and space charge, which generally requires a computer solution. We
can, however, sketch an approximate diagram without a detailed calculation. Given the experimental band offsets ∆Ev and ∆Ec, we can proceed
as follows:
1. Align the Fermi level with the two semiconductor bands separated.
Leave space for the transition region.

2. The metallurgical junction (x = 0) is located near the more heavily
doped side. At x = 0 put ∆Ev and ∆Ec, separated by the appropriate
band gaps.
Steps 2 and 3 of this procedure are where the exact band bending is
important and must be obtained by solving Poisson’s equation. In step 2 we
must use the band offset values ∆E
c and ∆Ev for the specific pair of semiconductors in the heterojunction.
18In discussing heterojunctions, it is common to use a capital N or P to designate the wide band gap material.
For heterojunctions in the GaAs–AlGaAs system, the direct (Г) band exaMPle 5–7
gap difference ∆EΓ g is accommodated approximately 2 3 in the conduction band and 1
3 in the valence band. For an Al composition of 0.3, the
AlGaAs is direct (see Fig. 3–6) with ∆EΓ g = 1.85 eV. Sketch the band diagrams for two heterojunction cases: N+-Al0.3Ga0.7As on n-type GaAs, and
N+-Al0.3Ga0.7As on p+-GaAs.18
Taking ∆Eg = 1.85 - 1.43 = 0.42 eV, the band offsets are ∆Ec = sOlutiOn
0.28 eV and ∆E
v = 0.14 eV. In each case we draw the equilibrium Fermi
level, add the appropriate bands far from the junction, add the band offsets while estimating the relative amounts of band bending and position
of x = 0 for the particular doping on the two sides, and finally sketch the
band edges so that Eg is maintained in each separate semiconductor right

A particularly important example of a heterojunction is shown in Figure
5–46, in which heavily n-type AlGaAs is grown on lightly doped GaAs. In this
example the discontinuity in the conduction band allows electrons to spill over
from the N+-AlGaAs into the GaAs, where they become trapped in the potential well. As a result, electrons collect on the GaAs side of the heterojunction
and move the Fermi level above the conduction band in the GaAs near the
interface. These electrons are confined in a narrow potential well in the GaAs
conduction band. If we construct a device in which conduction occurs parallel
to the interface, the electrons in such a potential well form a two-dimensional
electron gas with very interesting device properties. As we shall see in Chapter
6, electron conduction in such a potential well can result in very high mobility
electrons. This high mobility is due to the fact that the electrons in this wellJunctions 263

discrete states
(such as E1 and
E2) are formed,
as discussed in
Section 2.4.3.
5.1 Diodes and other semiconductor devices are made by combinations of steps
such as oxidation, selective doping (via implant or diffusion), and the deposition of various insulators or metals in concert with etching, using patterns
formed by photolithography.
5.2 When we bring p- and n-type semiconductors into contact to make a p-n junction diode, carriers diffuse across the junction until we get a flat Fermi level
in equilibrium. A built-in junction potential barrier is formed between the p
and n sides, which reflects the voltage drop across the depletion region. This
is a dynamic equilibrium, in which there is a continual diffusion of electrons
from the n to the p side (and holes from p to n), but at a reduced rate over the
potential barrier, and these fluxes are cancelled by opposing flows of minority
carriers diffusing to the depletion edges and getting swept across the junction.
5.3 The electrostatics of the depletion region are determined by solving the
Poisson’s equation. For uniformly doped abrupt step junctions we get linearly
varying electric fields that are highest at the metallurgical junction. We get a
suMMary
come from the AlGaAs, and not from doping in the GaAs. As a result, there is
negligible impurity scattering in the GaAs well, and the mobility is controlled
almost entirely by lattice scattering (phonons). At low temperatures, where
phonon scattering is low, the mobility in this region can be very high. If the
band bending in the GaAs conduction band is strong enough, the potential
well may be extremely narrow, so that discrete states such as E1 and E2 in Fig.
5–46 are formed. We will return to this example in Chapter 6.
Another obvious feature of Fig. 5–46 is that the concept of a contact potential barrier qV0 for both electrons and holes in a homojunction is no longer valid
for the heterojunction. In Fig. 5–46 the barrier for electrons qVn is smaller than
the barrier for holes qVp. This property of a heterojunction can be used to alter
the relative injection of electrons and holes, as we shall see in Section 7.9.264 Chapter 5
wider depletion region on the more lightly doped side and equal and opposite
depletion charges on the two sides of the junction.
5.4 For an ideal Shockley diode, one assumes negligible generation–recombination
inside the depletion region. In forward bias, the built-in potential barrier is
lowered, making it exponentially easier for majority carriers, to diffuse across.
5.5 The opposing minority carrier fluxes are unaffected because they are limited
by how often the few minority carriers diffuse to the depletion edges. Far from
the junction, the current is carried by drift of the majority carriers, which are
injected across the junction to the other side, where, as minority carriers, they
give rise to diffusion currents.
5.6 In reverse bias, for ideal diodes, the voltage-independent reverse current is due
to the collection of thermally generated minority carriers on either side diffusing to the depletion region and then being swept across. The current flow from
n to p is small and is the basis of diode rectifiers.
5.7 For high reverse biases, diodes undergo (reversible) breakdown due to quantum mechanical tunneling (Zener mechanism) across a narrow depletion
region for very heavily doped junctions or due to impact ionization or avalanche multiplication of carriers in a wider depletion region for lightly doped
junctions. For narrow diodes, there can also be punch-through from one contact to the other.
5.8 Varying the bias leads to diode switching; the diode transient behavior can be
found by solving the continuity equation, for example, using Laplace transforms, with suitable initial and boundary conditions.
5.9 Small signal capacitance in a semiconductor device is caused by a change in
the charge storage as a function of bias. There are two components of diode
capacitance: depletion capacitance, due to exposed dopant charges in the depletion region (dominates in reverse bias); and diffusion capacitance, due to stored
excess mobile carriers (dominates in forward bias).
5.10 Real diodes can deviate from Shockley “ideal’’ diodes, which have negligible
generation–recombination in the depletion region. Generation–recombination
in the depletion region increases the diode ideality factor n from 1 to 2 in forward bias and introduces a roughly square root voltage dependence of reverse
leakage current.
5.11 High-level carrier injection for large forward bias, in which the injected minority carrier concentration is comparable to the background majority carrier
concentration, also makes n = 2. Series resistance effects play a role as well
for higher currents.
5.12 Graded junctions, where the doping concentrations on either side are not constant, are qualitatively similar to abrupt junctions, but are harder to analyze.
They have different C–V than abrupt junctions have.
5.13 Metal–semiconductor junctions behave asSchottky diodes(if the Fermi level alignments are such that there is a depletion of majority carriers in the semiconductor)
or ohmic contacts (if there is no depletion region formed in the semiconductor).Junctions 265
5.14 Junctions between dissimilar semiconductors are called heterojunctions. With
respect to a vacuum reference level, one looks at the conduction band edges
(electron affinities) and band gaps to determine the band offsets and at the Fermi
levels (work functions) to determine the direction of carrier transfer. Electrons
flow from the high to low Fermi level regions, and holes flow the opposite way.

How long does it take to grow the first 200 nm, the next 300 nm, and the final
400 nm?
A square window (1 mm * 1 mm) is etched in this oxide, and the wafer is
reoxidized at 1150°C in wet oxygen such that the oxide thickness outside of
the window region increases to 2000 nm. Draw a cross section of the wafer
and mark off all the thicknesses, dimensions, and oxide–Si interfaces relative
to the original Si surface. Calculate the step heights in Si and in the oxide at
the edge of the window.
5.2 When impurities are diffused into a sample from an unlimited source such
that the surface concentration N0 is held constant, the impurity distribution
(profile) is given by
N(x, t) = N0 erfc a22xDt b
where D is the diffusion coefficient for the impurity, t is the diffusion time, and
erfc is the complementary error function.
If a certain number of impurities are placed in a thin layer on the surface before
diffusion, and if no impurities are added and none escape during diffusion, a
gaussian distribution is obtained:
N(x, t) =
Ns
2rDt e-(x>22Dt)2
where N
s is the quantity of impurity placed on the surface (atoms/cm2) prior to
t = 0. Notice that this expression differs from Eq. (4–44) by a factor of two. Why?
Figure P5–2 gives curves of the complementary error function and gaussian factors for the variable u, which in our case is x > 22Dt. Assume that
boron is diffused into n-type Si (uniform Nd = 5 * 1016 cm-3) at 1000°C

on the surface prior to diffusion (Ns = 5 * 1013 cm-2), and no additional B

5.32 We assumed in Section 5.2.3 that carriers are excluded within W and that the
semiconductor is neutral outside W. This is known as the depletion approximation. Obviously, such a sharp transition is unrealistic. In fact, the space charge
varies over a distance of several Debye lengths, given by
LD = c qPs2kT Nd d 1>2 on the n side.
Calculate the Debye length on the n side for Si junctions having Na = 1018 cm - 3

(xn = l), find the steady state charge in the excess hole distribution Qp and
the current I.
5.40 Assume that a p+-n diode is built with an n region width l smaller than a hole
diffusion length (l 6 Lp). This is the so-called narrow base diode. Since for
this case holes are injected into a short n region under forward bias, we cannot
use the assumption dp(xn = ∞) = 0 in Eq. (4–35). Instead, we must use as a
boundary condition the fact that dp = 0 at xn = l.
(a) Solve the diffusion equation to obtain
dp(xn) =
∆pn[e(l - xn)>Lp - e(xn - l)>Lp]

5.41 Given the narrow base diode result (Prob. 5.40), (a) calculate the current due
to recombination in the n region, and (b) show that the current due to recombination at the ohmic contact is
I(ohmic contact) = aqAD Lpppn csch Llp b (eqV>kT - 1)
5.42 Assume that a p+-n junction is built with a graded n region in which the doping
is described by Nd(x) = Gxm. The depletion region (W ≅ xn0) extends from
essentially the junction at x = 0 to a point W within the n region. The singularity at x = 0 for negative m can be neglected.
(a) Integrate Gauss’s law across the depletion region to obtain the maximum
value of the electric feld ℰ0 = -qGW (m + 1)/P(m + 1).
(b) Find the expression for (x), and use the result to obtain V0 - V =
qGW (m + 2)/P(m + 2).
(c) Find the charge Q due to ionized donors in the depletion region; write Q
explicitly in terms of (V0 - V).
(d) Using the results of (c), take the derivative dQ/d(V0 - V) to show that the
capacitance is

5.43 We deposit a metal with a work function of 4.6 eV on Si (electron affinity of 4 eV)
and acceptor doping level of 1018 cm-3. Draw the equilibrium band diagram
and mark off the Fermi level, the band edges, and the vacuum level. Is this a
Schottky or ohmic contact, and why? By how much should the metal work
function be altered to change the type of contact? Explain with reference to
the band diagram.
5.44 Design an ohmic contact for n-type GaAs using InAs, with an intervening
graded InGaAs region (see Fig. 5–44).
5.45 A Schottky barrier is formed between a metal having a work function of 4.3 eV
and p-type Si (electron affinity = 4 eV). The acceptor doping in the Si is
1017 cm - 3.
(a) Draw the equilibrium band diagram, showing a numerical value for qV0.
(b) Draw the band diagram with 0.3 V forward bias. Repeat for 2 V reverse bias.
5.46 We want to make a Schottky diode on one surface of an n-type semiconductor,
and an ohmic contact on the other side. The electron affinity is 5 eV, band gap
is 1.5 eV, and the Fermi potential is 0.25 eV? What should be values of work
functions of the two metals? (Give your answer as greater than or less than
certain values.) Sketch the band diagram of the structure.

Draw the equilibrium band diagram, marking off the band edge energies and
EF, with respect to the vacuum level.
Calculate the current density if the junction is forward biased such that the
minority concentrations are increased by a factor of 106.
(Hint: Use appropriate approximations. There is a lot of extraneous information here; the answer is very simple. Remember that this is a p+-n junction, and
the length of the semiconductors is V diffusion length; the minority carrier
concentration is zero at the ohmic contacts at both ends of the device.)
5.48 A p-n junction diode has a doping concentration of 1017 cm-3 on the p- side, and
double that on the n side. The intrinsic carrier concentration is 1011 cm-3, band
gap is 2 eV, and Pr = 15. Sketch the band diagram in equilibrium, and mark
off the values of band edges with respect to the Fermi level and the depletion
widths on both sides.
Repeat the above for a heterojunction, where the band gap on the n side is
reduced to 1 eV, and the electron affinity on the n side is 4 eV. Other parameters are kept the same. Band offsets are the same for conduction and valence
bands across the heterojunction.

Chapter 6
Field-Effect Transistors
The modern era of semiconductor electronics was ushered in by the invention of the bipolar transistor in 1948 by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley
at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. This device, along with its field-effect
counterpart, has had an enormous impact on virtually every area of modern
life. In this chapter we will learn about the operation, applications, and fabrication of the field-effect transistor (FET).
The FET comes in several forms. In a junction FET (called a JFET)
the control (gate) voltage varies the depletion width of a reverse-biased p-n
junction.A similar device results if the junction is replaced by a Schottky barrier (metal – semiconductor FET, called a MESFET). Alternatively, the metal
gate electrode may be separated from the semiconductor by an insulator
(metal–insulator–semiconductor FET, called a MISFET). A common special
case of this type uses an oxide layer as the insulator (MOSFET).
In Chapter 5 we found that two dominant features of p-n junctions
are the injection of minority carriers with forward bias and a variation of
the depletion width W with reverse bias. These two p-n junction properties
are used in two important types of transistors. The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) discussed in Chapter 7 uses the injection of minority carriers across
a forward-biased junction, and the JFET discussed in this chapter depends on
control of a junction depletion width under reverse bias. The FET is a majority carrier device, and is therefore often called a unipolar transistor. The BJT,

2. Determine MOS C–V behavior and threshold voltage; study leakage

4. Understand “effective” channel mobility, body effect, and subthreshold

5. Analyze second-order effects—DIBL, GIDL, charge sharing, and VT
roll-off278 Chapter 6
on the other hand, operates by the injection and collection of minority carriers. Since the action of both electrons and holes is important in this device, it
is called a bipolar transistor. Like its bipolar counterpart, the FET is a threeterminal device in which the current through two terminals is controlled at
the third. Unlike the BJT, however, field-effect devices are controlled by a
voltage at the third terminal rather than by a current.
The history of BJTs and FETs is rather interesting. It was the FET that
was proposed first in 1930 by Lilienfeld, but he never got it to work because
he did not fully appreciate the role of surface defects or surface states. In
the process of trying to demonstrate experimentally such a FET, Bardeen
and Brattain somewhat serendipitously invented the first bipolar transistor, the Ge point contact transistor. This major breakthrough was rapidly
followed by Shockley’s extension of the concept to the BJT. It was only
much later, after the problem of surface states was resolved by growing an
oxide insulator on Si, that the first MOSFET was demonstrated in 1960 by
Kahng and Atalla. Although the BJT reigned supreme in the early days of
semiconductor-integrated electronics, it has been gradually supplanted in
most applications by the Si MOSFET. The main reason is, unlike BJTs, the
various types of FET are characterized by a high input impedance, since the
control voltage is applied to a reverse-biased junction or Schottky barrier, or
across an insulator. These devices are particularly well suited for controlled
switching between a conducting state and a nonconducting state, and are
therefore useful in digital circuits. They are also suitable for integration of
many devices on a single chip, as we shall see in Chapter 9. In fact, billions
of MOS transistors are commonly used together in semiconductor memory
devices and microprocessors.
We begin this section with a general discussion of amplification and switching, the basic circuit functions performed by transistors. The transistor is a
three-terminal device with the important feature that the current through
two terminals can be controlled by small changes we make in the current
or voltage at the third terminal. This control feature allows us to amplify
small a-c signals or to switch the device from an on state to an off state and
back. These two operations, amplification and switching, are the basis of a
host of electronic functions. This section provides a brief introduction to
these operations, as a foundation for understanding both bipolar and fieldeffect transistors.
6.1.1 The Load Line
Consider a two-terminal device (Fig. 6-1a) that has a nonlinear I–V characteristic, as in Fig. 6–1b. We might determine this curve experimentally by
measuring the current for various applied voltages. When such a device is
biased with the simple battery–resistor combination shown in the figure,
6.1
TransisTOr
OpEraTiOn­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 279
steady state values of ID and VD are attained. To find these values we begin
by writing a loop equation around the circuit:1
E = iDR + vD (6–1)
This gives us one equation describing the circuit, but it contains two unknowns
(iD and vD). Fortunately, we have another equation of the form iD = f (vD)
in the curve of Fig. 6–1b, giving us two equations with two unknowns. The
steady state current and voltage are found by a simultaneous solution of
these two equations. However, since one equation is analytical and the other
is graphical, we must first put them into the same form. It is easy to make the
linear equation (6–1) graphical, so we plot it on Fig. 6–1b to find the simultaneous solution. The end points of the line described by Eq. (6–1) are at E
when iD = 0 and at E>R when vD = 0. The two graphs cross at vD = VD and
iD = ID, the steady state values of current and voltage for the device with
this biasing circuit.
Now let’s add a third terminal which somehow controls the I–V characteristic of the device (Fig. 6-2a). For example, assume that the device current–
voltage curve can be moved up the current axis by increasing the control
voltage as in Fig. 6–2b. This results in a family of iD - vD curves, depending
upon the choice of vG. We can still write the loop equation (6–1) and draw it
on the set of curves, but now the simultaneous solution depends on the value
of vG. In the example of Fig. 6–2, VG is 0.5 V and the d-c values of ID and VD
are found at the intersection to be 10 mA and 5 V, respectively. Whatever
the value of the control voltage vG at the third terminal, values of ID and VD
are obtained from points along the line representing Eq. (6–1).This is called
the load line.
6.1.2 amplification and switching
If an a-c source is added to the control voltage, we can achieve large variations in iD by making small changes in vG. For example, as vG varies about its

d-c value by 0.25 V in Fig. 6–2, vd varies about its d-c value VD by 2 V. Thus the
amplification of the a-c signal is 2/0.25 = 8. If the curves for equal changes in
vG are equally spaced on the iD axis, a faithful amplified version of the small
control signal can be obtained. This type of voltage-controlled amplification
is typical of FETs. For bipolar transistors, a small control current is used to
achieve large changes in the device current, achieving current amplification.
Another important circuit function of transistors is the controlled
switching of the device off and on. In the example of Fig. 6–2, we can switch
from the bottom of the load line (iD = 0) to almost the top (iD ≃ E>R)
by appropriate changes in vG. This type of switching with control at a third
terminal is particularly useful in digital circuits.

ThE juncTiOn
FET
In a junction FET (JFET) the voltage-variable depletion region width of a
junction is used to control the effective cross-sectional area of a conducting
channel. In the device of Fig. 6–3, the current ID flows through an n-type
channel between two p+ regions. A reverse bias between these p+ regions
and the channel causes the depletion regions to intrude into the n material,
and therefore the effective width of the channel can be restricted. Since
the resistivity of the channel region is fixed by its doping, the channel
resistance varies with changes in the effective cross-sectional area. By analogy, the variable depletion regions serve as the two doors of a gate, which
open and close on the conducting channel.
In Fig. 6–3 electrons in the n-type channel drift from left to right, opposite to current flow. The end of the channel from which electrons flow is
called the source, and the end toward which they flow is called the drain. The
p+ regions are called gates. If the channel were p type, holes would flow from­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 281
the source to the drain, in the same direction as the current flow, and the gate
regions would be n+. It is common practice to connect the two gate regions
electrically; therefore, the voltage VG refers to the potential from each gate
region G to the source S. Since the conductivity of the heavily doped p+
regions is high, we can assume that the potential is uniform throughout each
gate. In the lightly doped channel material, however, the potential varies with
position (Fig. 6–3b). If the channel of Fig. 6–3 is considered as a distributed
resistor carrying a current ID it is clear that the voltage from the drain end
of the channel D to the source electrode S must be greater than the voltage from a point near the source end to S. For low values of current we can
assume a linear variation of voltage Vx in the channel, varying from VD at the
drain end to zero at the source end (Fig. 6–3b).
6.2.1 pinch-off and saturation
In Fig. 6–4 we consider the channel in a simplified way by neglecting voltage drops between the source and drain electrodes and the respective ends
of the channel. For example, we assume that the potential at the drain end
of the channel is the same as the potential at the electrode D. This is a
good approximation if the source and drain regions are relatively large, so
that there is little resistance between the ends of the channel and the electrodes. In Fig. 6–4 the gates are short circuited to the source (VG = 0), such
that the potential at x = 0 is the same as the potential everywhere in the
gate regions. For very small currents, the widths of the depletion regions are

close to the equilibrium values (Fig. 6–4a). As the current ID is increased,
however, it becomes important that Vx is large near the drain end and small
near the source end of the channel. Since the reverse bias across each point
in the gate-to-channel junction is simply Vx when VG is zero, we can estimate
the shape of the depletion regions as in Fig. 6–4b. The reverse bias is relatively large near the drain (VGD = -VD) and decreases toward zero near the
source. As a result, the depletion region intrudes into the channel near the
drain, and the effective channel area is constricted.
Since the resistance of the constricted channel is higher, the I–V plot
for the channel begins to depart from the straight line that was valid at low
current levels. As the voltage VD and current ID are increased still further,
the channel region near the drain becomes more constricted by the depletion
regions and the channel resistance continues to increase. As VD is increased,
there must be some bias voltage at which the depletion regions meet near
the drain and essentially pinch-off the channel (Fig. 6–4c). When this happens, the current ID cannot increase significantly with further increase in
VD. Beyond pinch-off the current is saturated approximately at its value at
pinch-off.2 Once electrons from the channel enter the electric field of the

depletion region, they are swept through and ultimately flow to the positive
drain contact. After the current saturates beyond pinch-off, the differential
channel resistance dVD>dID becomes very high. To a good approximation, we
can calculate the current at the critical pinch-off voltage and assume there is
no further increase in current as VD is increased.
6.2.2 Gate control
The effect of a negative gate bias -VG is to increase the resistance of the
channel and induce pinch-off at a lower value of current (Fig. 6–5). Since
the depletion regions are larger with VG negative, the effective channel
width is smaller and its resistance is higher in the low-current range of the
characteristic. Therefore, the slopes of the ID vs. VD curves below pinchoff become smaller as the gate voltage is made more negative (Fig. 6–5b).
The pinch-off condition is reached at a lower drain-to-source voltage, and
the saturation current is lower than for the case of zero gate bias. As VG
is varied, a family of curves is obtained for the I–V characteristic of the
channel, as in Fig. 6–5b.
Beyond the pinch-off voltage the drain current ID is controlled by VG.
By varying the gate bias we can obtain amplification of an a-c signal. Since
the input control voltage VG appears across the reverse-biased gate junctions,
the input impedance of the device is high.
We can calculate the pinch-off voltage rather simply by representing
the channel in the approximate form of Fig. 6–6. If the channel is symmetrical
and the effects of the gates are the same in each half of the channel region,
we can restrict our attention to the channel half-width h(x), measured from
the center line (y = 0). The metallurgical half-width of the channel (i.e.,
neglecting the depletion region) is a. We can find the pinch-off voltage by
calculating the reverse bias between the n channel and the p+ gate at the
drain end of the channel (x = L). For simplicity we shall assume that the
channel width at the drain decreases uniformly as the reverse bias increases

to pinch-off. If the reverse bias between the gate and the drain is -VGD, the
width of the depletion region at x = L can be found from Eq. (5–57):
W(x = L) = c 2P(qN -VdGD) d 1>2 (VGD negative) (6–2)
In this expression we assume the equilibrium contact potential V0 is negligible compared with VGD and the depletion region extends primarily into the
channel for the p+-n junction. Including V0 is left for Prob. 6.1.
Pinch-off occurs at the drain end of the channel when
h(x = L) = a - W(x = L) = 0 (6–3)
that is, when W(x = L) = a. If we define the value of -VGD at pinch-off as

where VG is zero or negative for proper device operation. A forward bias
on the gate would cause hole injection from the p+ regions into the channel, eliminating the field-effect control of the device. From Eq. (6–5) it is
clear that pinch-off results from a combination of gate-to-source voltage
and drain-to-source voltage. Pinch-off is reached at a lower value of VD (and
therefore a lower ID) when a negative gate bias is applied, in agreement with
Fig. 6–5b.
6.2.3 current–voltage characteristics
Calculation of the exact channel current is complicated, although the mathematics is relatively straightforward below pinch-off. The approach we shall
take is to find the expression for ID just at pinch-off, and then assume the
saturation current beyond pinch-off remains fairly constant at this value.
In the coordinate system defined in Fig. 6–6, the center of the channel at the source end is taken as the origin. The length of the channel in the
x-direction is L, and the depth of channel in the z-direction is Z. We shall
call the resistivity of the n-type channel material t (valid only in the neutral
n material, outside the depletion regions). If we consider the differential volume of neutral channel material Z2h(x)dx, the resistance of the volume element is tdx>Z2h(x) [see Eq. (3–44)]. Since the current does not change with
distance along the channel, ID is related to the differential voltage change in
the element dV
x by the conductance of the element:
ID
=
Z2h(x)
t
dV
x
dx (6–6)
The term 2h(x) is the channel width at x.
The half-width of the channel at point x depends on the local reverse
bias between gate and channel -VGx:
h(x) = a - W(x) = a - c 2P(qN -VdGx) d 1>2 = ac 1 -aVx V-PVG b 1>2 d (6–7)
since VGx = VG - Vx and Vp = qa2Nd/2P. Implicit in Eq. (6–7) is the assumption that the expression for W(x) can be obtained by a simple extension of
Eq. (6–2) to point x in the channel. This is called the gradual channel approximation; it is valid if h(x) does not vary abruptly in any element dx.
The voltage VGx will be negative since the gate voltage VG is chosen
zero or negative for proper operation. Substituting Eq. (6–7) into Eq. (6–6),
we have
2Za
r c 1 - aVx V-PVG b 1>2 d dVx = IDdx (6–8)
We can solve this equation to obtain
ID
= G0VPc VVDP + 2 3 a- VVGP b 3>2 - 2 3 aVD V-P VG b 3>2 d (6–9)286 Chapter 6
where VG is negative and G0 K 2aZ>tL is the conductance of the channel for
negligible W(x), that is, with no gate voltage and low values of ID. This equation is valid only up to pinch-off, where VD-VG = VP. If we assume the saturation current remains essentially constant at its value at pinch-off, we have
ID
(sat.) = G0VP c VVDP + 2 3 a- VVGP b 3>2 - 2 3 d
= G0VP c VVGP + 2 3 a- VVGP b 3>2 + 1 3 d
(6–10)
where
VD
VP
= 1 +
VG
VP
The resulting family of I–V curves for the channel agrees with the results we
predicted qualitatively (Fig. 6–5b). The saturation current is greatest when
VG is zero and becomes smaller as VG is made negative.
We can represent the device biased in the saturation region by an
equivalent circuit where changes in drain current are related to gate voltage
changes by
gm(sat.) =
0ID(sat.)
0VG
= G0c 1 - a- VVGP b 1>2 d (6–11)
The quantity gm is the mutual transconductance, with units (A/V) called siemens (S), sometimes called mhos. As a figure of merit for FET devices it is
common to describe the transconductance per unit channel width Z. This
quantity gm>Z is usually given in units of millisiemens per millimeter.
It is found experimentally that a square-law characteristic closely
approximates the drain current in saturation:
ID
(sat.) ≃ IDSS a1 + VVGP b 2, (VG negative) (6–12)
where IDSS is the saturated drain current with VG = 0.
The appearance of a constant value of channel resistivity (in the G0
term) in Eqs. (6–9)–(6–11) implies that the electron mobility is constant. As
mentioned in Section 3.4.4, electron velocity saturation at high fields may
make this assumption invalid. This is particularly likely for very short channels, where even moderate drain voltage can result in a high field along
the channel. Another departure from the ideal model results from the fact
that the effective channel length decreases as the drain voltage is increased
beyond pinch-off, as Fig. 6–4c suggests. In short channel devices this effect
can cause ID to increase beyond pinch-off, since L appears in the denominator of Eq. (6–10), in G0. Therefore, the assumption of constant saturation
current is not valid for very short channel devices.­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 287
The depletion of the channel discussed above for a JFET can be accomplished by the use of a reverse-biased Schottky barrier instead of a p-n
junction. The resulting device is called a MESFET, indicating that a metal–
semiconductor junction is used.This device is useful in high-speed digital or
microwave circuits, where the simplicity of Schottky barriers allows fabrication to close geometrical tolerances. There are particular speed advantages
for MESFET devices in III–V compounds such as GaAs or InP, which have
higher mobilities and carrier drift velocities than Si.
6.3.1 The Gaas MEsFET
Figure 6–7 shows schematically a simple MESFET in GaAs. The substrate is
undoped or doped with chromium, which has an energy level near the center of the GaAs band gap. In either case the Fermi level is near the center
of the gap, resulting in very high resistivity material 1∼108 Ω­cm2 generally
called semi-insulating GaAs. On this nonconducting substrate a thin layer of
lightly doped n-type GaAs is grown epitaxially, to form the channel region
of the FET.3 The photolithographic processing consists of defining patterns
in the metal layers for source and drain ohmic contacts (e.g.,Au–Ge) and for
the Schottky barrier gate (e.g., Al). By reverse biasing the Schottky gate, the
channel can be depleted to the semi-insulating substrate, and the resulting
I–V characteristics are similar to the JFET device.
By using GaAs instead of Si, a higher electron mobility is available (see
Appendix III), and furthermore GaAs can be operated at higher temperatures (and therefore higher power levels). Since no diffusions are involved
in Fig. 6–7, close geometrical tolerances can be achieved and the MESFET
can be made very small. Gate lengths L f 50 nm are common in these
devices. This is important at high frequencies, since drift time and capacitances must be kept to a minimum.
It is possible to avoid the epitaxial growth of the n-type layer and the
etched isolation in Fig. 6–7 by using ion implantation. Starting with a semiinsulating GaAs substrate, a thin n-type layer at the surface of each transistor
region can be formed by implanting Si or a column VI donor impurity such

as Se. This implantation requires an anneal to remove the radiation damage,
but the epitaxial growth step is eliminated. In either the fully implanted
device or the epitaxial device of Fig. 6–7, the source and drain contacts may
be improved by further n+ implantation in these regions. Because of the
relative simplicity of implanted GaAs MESFETs and the isolation between
devices provided by the semi-insulating substrate, these structures are commonly used in GaAs integrated circuits.
6.3.2 The high Electron Mobility Transistor (hEMT)
Since the metal–semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET) is compatible with the use of III–V compounds, it is possible to exploit the band
gap engineering available with heterojunctions in these materials. In order
to maintain high transconductance in a MESFET, the channel conductivity
must be as high as possible. Obviously, the conductivity can be increased
by increasing the doping in the channel and thus the carrier concentration. However, increased doping also causes increased scattering by the
ionized impurities, which leads to a degradation of mobility (see Fig. 3–23).
What is needed is a way of creating a high electron concentration in the
channel of a MESFET by some means other than doping. A clever approach
to this requirement is to grow a thin undoped well (e.g., GaAs) bounded by
wider band gap, doped barriers (e.g., AlGaAs). This configuration, called
modulation doping, results in conductive GaAs when electrons from the
doped AlGaAs barriers fall into the well and become trapped there, as
shown in Fig. 6–8a. Since the donors are in the AlGaAs rather than the
GaAs, there is no impurity scattering of electrons in the well. If a MESFET
is constructed with the channel along the GaAs well (perpendicular to the
page in Fig. 6–8), we can take advantage of this reduced scattering and

resulting higher mobility. The effect is especially strong at low temperature
where lattice (phonon) scattering is also low. This device is called a modulation doped field-effect transistor (MODFET) and is also called a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT).
In Fig. 6–8a we have left out the band bending expected at the
AlGaAs/GaAs interfaces. Based upon the discussion in Section 5.8, we
expect the electrons to accumulate at the corners of the well due to band
bending at the heterojunction. In fact, only one heterojunction is required
to trap electrons, as shown in Fig. 6–8b. Generally, the donors in the AlGaAs
layer are purposely separated from the interface by ~100 Å. Using this configuration, we can achieve a high electron concentration in the channel while
retaining high mobility, since the GaAs channel region is spatially separated
from the ionized impurities which provide the free carriers.
In Fig. 6–8b, mobile electrons generated by the donors in the AlGaAs
diffuse into the small band gap GaAs layer, and they are prevented from
returning to the AlGaAs by the potential barrier at the AlGaAs/GaAs interface. The electrons in the (almost) triangular well form a two-dimensional
electron gas (sometimes abbreviated 2-DEG). Sheet carrier densities as
high as 1012 cm-2 can be obtained at a single interface such as that shown
in Fig. 6–8b. Ionized impurity scattering is greatly reduced simply by separating the electrons from the donors. Also, screening effects due to the
extremely high density of the two-dimensional electron gas can reduce
ionized impurity scattering further. In properly designed structures, the
electron transport approaches that of bulk GaAs with no impurities, so
that mobility is limited by lattice scattering. As a result, mobilities above
250,000 cm2/V­s at 77 K and 2,000,000 cm2/V­s at 4 K can be achieved.
The advantages of a HEMT are its ability to locate a large electron
density (~1012 cm-2) in a very thin layer (6 100 Å thick) very close to the
gate while simultaneously eliminating ionized impurity scattering. The
AlGaAs layer in a HEMT is fully depleted under normal operating conditions, and since the electrons are confined to the heterojunction, device
behavior closely resembles that of a MOSFET. The advantages of the HEMT
over the Si MOSFET are the higher mobility and maximum electron velocity in GaAs compared with Si, and the smoother interfaces possible with
an AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction compared with the Si/SiO2 interface. The
high performance of the HEMT translates into an extremely high cutoff
frequency, and devices with fast access times.
Although we have discussed the HEMT in terms of the AlGaAs/GaAs
heterojunction, other materials are also promising, such as the InGaAsP/InP
system. A motivation for avoiding AlxGa1 - xAs is the presence of a deep-level
defect called the DX center for x 7 0.2, which traps electrons and impairs
the HEMT operation. Since very thin layers are involved, materials with
slight lattice mismatch can be grown to form pseudomorphic HEMTs. An
example of such a system is the use of a thin layer of InGaAs grown pseudomorphically on GaAs, followed by AlGaAs. An advantage of this system
is that a useful band discontinuity can be achieved using AlGaAs of low
enough Al composition to avoid the DX center problem.290 Chapter 6
The HEMT, or MODFET, is also referred to as a two-dimensional electron gas FET (2-DEG FET, or TEGFET) to emphasize the fact that conduction along the channel occurs in a thin sheet of charge. The device has also
been called a separately doped FET (SEDFET), to emphasize the fact that
the doping occurs in a separate region from the channel.
6.3.3 short channel Effects
As mentioned in Section 6.2.3, a variety of modifications to the simple theory
of JFET and MESFET operation must be made when the channel length
is small (typically 6 1 om). In the past, these short channel effects would
be considered unusual, but now it is common to encounter FET devices in
which these effects dominate the I–V characteristics. For example, high-field
effects occur when 1 V appears across a channel length of 1 om (10 - 4 cm),
giving an electric field of 10 kV/cm.
A simple piecewise-linear approximation to the velocity–field curve
assumes a constant mobility (linear) dependence up to some critical field
ℰ
c and a constant saturation velocity vs for higher fields. For Si a better
approximation is
vd =
oℰ
1 + oℰ>vs (6–13)
where o is the low-field mobility. These two approximations are shown in
Fig. 6–9a. If we assume that the electrons passing through the channel drift
with a constant saturation velocity vs, the current takes a simple form
ID
= qnvsA = qNdvsZh (6–14)
where h is a slow function of VG. In this case the saturated current follows
the velocity saturation, and does not require a true pinch-off in the sense
of depletion regions meeting at some point in the channel. In the saturated
velocity case, the transconductance gm is essentially constant, in contrast with
the constant mobility case described by Eq. (6–11). As shown in Fig. 6–9b,
the ID - VD curves are more evenly spaced if constant saturation velocity
dominates, compared with the VG-dependent spacing shown in Fig. 6–5b for
the long-channel constant-mobility case.
Most devices operate with characteristics intermediate between the
constant mobility and the constant velocity regimes. Depending on the
details of the field distribution, it is possible to divide up the channel into
regions dominated by the two extreme cases, or to use an approximation
such as Eq. (6–13).
Another important short channel effect, described in Section 6.2.3, is
the reduction in effective channel length after pinch-off as the drain voltage
is increased. This effect is not significant in long-channel devices, since the
change in L due to intrusion of the depletion region is a minor fraction of the
total channel length. In short channel devices, however, the effective channel
length can be substantially shortened, leading to a slope in the saturated I–V­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 291
characteristic that is analogous to the Early (base-width narrowing) effect in
bipolar transistors discussed in Section 7.7.2.

One of the most widely used electronic devices, particularly in digital integrated circuits, is the metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) transistor. In this
device the channel current is controlled by a voltage applied at a gate electrode that is isolated from the channel by an insulator. The resulting device
may be referred to generically as an insulated-gate field-effect transistor
(IGFET). However, since most such devices are made using silicon for the
semiconductor, SiO2 or other oxides for the insulator, and metal or heavily
doped polysilicon for the gate electrode, the term MOS field-effect transistor
(MOSFET) is commonly used.
6.4.1 basic Operation and Fabrication
The basic MOS transistor is illustrated in Fig. 6–10a for the case of an
enhancement-mode n-channel device formed on a p-type Si substrate. The
n+ source and drain regions are diffused or implanted into a relatively lightly
doped p-type substrate, and a thin oxide layer separates the conducting gate
from the Si surface. No current flows from drain to source without a conducting n channel between them. This can be understood clearly by looking at the
band diagram of the MOSFET in equilibrium along the channel (Fig. 6–10a).
The Fermi level is flat in equilibrium. The conduction band is close to the
Fermi level in the n+source/drain, while the valence band is closer to the
Fermi level in the p-type material. Hence, there is a potential barrier for an
electron to go from the source to the drain, corresponding to the built-in
potential of the back-to-back p-n junctions between the source and drain.

When a positive voltage is applied to the gate relative to the substrate
(which is connected to the source in this case), positive charges are in effect
deposited on the gate metal. In response, negative charges are induced in the
underlying Si, by the formation of a depletion region and a thin surface region
containing mobile electrons. These induced electrons form the channel of the
FET, and allow current to flow from drain to source. As Fig. 6–10b suggests,
the effect of the gate voltage is to vary the conductance of this induced channel for low drain-to-source voltage, analogous to the JFET case. Since electrons are electrostatically induced in the p-type channel region, the channel­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 293
becomes less p-type, and therefore the valence band moves down, farther
away from the Fermi level. This obviously reduces the barrier for electrons
between the source, the channel, and the drain. If the barrier is reduced
sufficiently by applying a gate voltage in excess of what is known as the
threshold voltage, VT, there is significant current flow from the source to the
drain. Thus, one view of a MOSFET is that it is a gate-controlled potential
barrier. It is very important to have high-quality, low-leakage p-n junctions
in order to ensure a low off-state leakage in the MOSFET. For a given value
of VG there will be some drain voltage VD for which the current becomes
saturated, after which it remains essentially constant.
The threshold voltage VT is the minimum gate voltage required to
induce the channel. In general, the positive gate voltage of an n-channel
device (such as that shown in Fig. 6–11) must be larger than some value VT
before a conducting channel is induced. Similarly, a p-channel device (made
on an n-type substrate with p-type source and drain implants or diffusions)
requires a gate voltage more negative than some threshold value to induce the
required positive charge (mobile holes) in the channel. There are exceptions
to this general rule, however, as we shall see. For example, some n-channel
devices have a channel already with zero gate voltage, and in fact a negative
gate voltage is required to turn the device off. Such a “normally on” device
is called a depletion-mode transistor, since gate voltage is used to deplete a
channel which exists at equilibrium. The more common MOS transistor is
“normally off” with zero gate voltage, and operates in the enhancement mode
by applying gate voltage large enough to induce a conducting channel.
An alternative view of a MOSFET is that it is a gate-controlled resistor. If the (positive) gate voltage exceeds the threshold voltage in an n-channel
device, electrons are induced in the p-type substrate. Since this channel is
connected to the n+ source and drain regions, the structure looks electrically
like an induced n-type resistor. As the gate voltage increases, more electron
charge is induced in the channel and, therefore, the channel becomes more
conducting. The drain current initially increases linearly with the drain bias
(the linear regime) (Fig. 6–10b). As more drain current flows in the channel,
however, there is more ohmic voltage drop along the channel such that the
channel potential varies from zero near the grounded source to whatever the
applied drain potential is near the drain end of the channel. Hence, the voltage difference between the gate and the channel reduces from VG near the
source to (VG - VD) near the drain end. Once the drain bias is increased to the
point that (VG - VD) = VT, threshold is barely maintained near the drain end,
and the channel is said to be pinched off. Increasing the drain bias beyond
this point (VD (sat.)) causes the point at which the channel gets pinched off to
move more and more into the channel, closer to the source end (Fig. 6–11c).
Electrons in the channel are pulled into the pinch-off region and travel at
the saturation drift velocity because of the very high longitudinal electric
field along the channel. Now, the drain current is said to be in the saturation
region because it does not increase with drain bias significantly (Fig. 6–10b).
Actually, there is a slight increase of drain current with drain bias due to294 Chapter 6

various effects such as channel length modulation and drain-induced barrier
lowering (DIBL) that will be discussed in Section 6.5.10.
The MOS transistor is particularly useful in digital circuits, in which it is
switched from the “off” state (no conducting channel) to the “on” state. The
control of drain current is obtained at a gate electrode which is insulated
from the source and drain by the oxide. Thus the d-c input impedance of an
MOS circuit can be very large.
Both n-channel and p-channel MOS transistors are in common
usage. The n-channel type illustrated in Fig. 6–10 is generally preferred
because it takes advantage of the fact that the electron mobility in Si is
larger than the mobility of holes. In much of the discussion to follow we will
use the n-channel (p-type substrate) example, although the p-channel case
will be kept in mind also.
Let us give a very simplified description of how such an n-channel
MOSFET can be fabricated. A much more detailed discussion is given in
Section 9.3.1. An ultra-thin (~ few Angstroms) dry thermal silicon dioxide is
grown on the p-type substrate, followed by deposition of a so-called high-k
dielectric such as HfO2. This serves as the gate insulator between the conducting gate and the channel. We cover it with a metal electrode which is then
patterned to form the gates, and etched anisotropically by reactive ion etching (RIE) to achieve vertical walls (Section 5.1.7). The gate itself is used as an
implant mask for an n+ implant which forms the source/drain junctions abutted to the gate edges, but is blocked from the channel region. Such a scheme is
called a self-aligned process because we did not have to use a separate lithography step for the source/drain formation. Self-alignment is simple and is very
useful because we thereby guarantee that there will be some overlap of the
gate with the source/drain but not too much overlap. The advantages of this
are discussed in Section 6.5.8. The implanted dopants must be annealed for
reasons discussed in Section 5.1.4. Finally, the MOSFETs have to be properly interconnected according to the circuit layout, using metallization. This
involves LPCVD of an oxide dielectric, etching contact holes by RIE, depositing a suitable metal such as Cu, patterning and etching it.
As shown in Fig. 6–10a, the MOSFET is surrounded on all sides by
a thick SiO2 layer. This layer provides critical electrical isolation between
adjacent transistors on an integrated circuit. We shall see in Section 9.3.1 that
such isolation or field regions can be formed by Shallow Trench Isolation
(STI). Shallow grooves or trenches are etched in the substrate using RIE, and
a thermal oxide is grown to passivate the surface and fill up the trench with
LPCVD of SiO2. The reason why a thick field oxide layer leads to electrical
isolation is discussed in Section 6.5.5.
6.4.2 The ideal MOs capacitor
The surface effects that arise in an apparently simple MOS structure are actually quite complicated. Although many of these effects are beyond the scope
of this discussion, we will be able to identify those which control typical MOS296 Chapter 6
transistor operation. We begin by considering an uncomplicated idealized
case, and then include effects encountered in real surfaces in the next section.
Some important definitions are made in the energy band diagram of
Fig. 6–12a. The work function characteristic of the metal (see Section 2.2.1)
can be defined in terms of the energy required to move an electron from
the Fermi level to outside the metal. In MOS work it is more convenient to
use a modified work function qΦm for the metal–oxide interface. The energy
qΦm is measured from the metal Fermi level to the conduction band of the
oxide.4 Similarly, qΦs is the modified work function at the semiconductor–
oxide interface. In this idealized case we assume that Φ
m = Φs, so there is
no difference in the two work functions. Another quantity that will be useful
in later discussions is qfF, which measures the position of the Fermi level
below the intrinsic level Ei for the semiconductor. This quantity indicates
how strongly p-type the semiconductor is [see Eq. (3–25)].
The MOS structure of Fig. 6–12a is essentially a capacitor in which one
plate is a semiconductor. If we apply a negative voltage between the metal
and the semiconductor (Fig. 6–12b), we effectively deposit a negative charge
on the metal. In response, we expect an equal net positive charge to accumulate at the surface of the semiconductor. In the case of a p-type substrate this
occurs by hole accumulation at the semiconductor–oxide interface.
Since the applied negative voltage depresses the electrostatic potential of
the metal relative to the semiconductor, the electron energies are raised in the
metal relative to the semiconductor.5As a result, the Fermi level for the metal
EFm lies above its equilibrium position by qV, where V is the applied voltage.
Since Φ
m and Φs do not change with applied voltage, moving EFm up in
energy relative to EFs causes a tilt in the oxide conduction band. We expect
such a tilt since an electric field causes a gradient in Ei (and similarly in
E
v and Ec) as described in Section 4.4.2:
ℰ(x) = 1
q
dEi
dx (see 4–26)
The energy bands of the semiconductor bend near the interface to
accommodate the accumulation of holes. Since
p = nie(Ei - EF)>kT (see 3–25)
it is clear that an increase in hole concentration implies an increase in Ei-EF
at the semiconductor surface.
Since no current passes through the MOS structure, there can be no
variation in the Fermi level within the semiconductor. Therefore, if Ei - EF
is to increase, it must occur by Ei moving up in energy near the surface.

The result is a bending of the semiconductor bands near the interface. We
notice in Fig. 6–12b that the Fermi level near the interface lies closer to the
valence band, indicating a larger hole concentration than that arising from
the doping of the p-type semiconductor.
In Fig. 6–12c we apply a positive voltage from the metal to the semiconductor. This raises the potential of the metal, lowering the metal Fermi level
by qV relative to its equilibrium position. As a result, the oxide conduction
band is again tilted. We notice that the slope of this band, obtained by simply moving the metal side down relative to the semiconductor side, is in the
proper direction for the applied field, according to Eq. (4–26).
The positive voltage deposits positive charge on the metal and calls for
a corresponding net negative charge at the surface of the semiconductor. Such
a negative charge in p-type material arises from depletion of holes from
the region near the surface, leaving behind uncompensated ionized acceptors. This is analogous to the depletion region at a p-n junction discussed in
Section 5.2.3. In the depleted region the hole concentration decreases, moving
Ei closer to EF, and bending the bands down near the semiconductor surface.
If we continue to increase the positive voltage, the bands at the semiconductor surface bend down more strongly. In fact, a sufficiently large voltage can bend Ei below EF (Fig. 6–12d).This is a particularly interesting case,
since EF ⪢ Ei implies a large electron concentration in the conduction band.
The region near the semiconductor surface in this case has conduction
properties typical of n-type material, with an electron concentration given
by Eq. (3–25a). This n-type surface layer is formed not by doping, but instead
by inversion of the originally p-type semiconductor due to the applied voltage. This inverted layer, separated from the underlying p-type material by a
depletion region, is the key to MOS transistor operation.
We should take a closer look at the inversion region, since it becomes
the conducting channel in the FET. In Fig. 6–13 we define a potential h at
any point x, measured relative to the equilibrium position of Ei. The energy
qh tells us the extent of band bending at x, and qhs represents the band
bending at the surface. We notice that hs = 0 is the flat band condition for
this ideal MOS case (i.e., the bands look like Fig. 6–12a). When hs 6 0, the
bands bend up at the surface, and we have hole accumulation (Fig. 6–12b).
Similarly, when hs 7 0, we have depletion (Fig. 6–12c). Finally, when hs is
positive and larger than hF the bands at the surface are bent down such that
Ei(x = 0) lies below EF, and inversion is obtained (Fig. 6–12d).
While it is true that the surface is inverted whenever hs is larger than
fF, a practical criterion is needed to tell us whether a true n-type conducting channel exists at the surface. The best criterion for strong inversion is
that the surface should be as strongly n-type as the substrate is p type. That
is, Ei should lie as far below EF at the surface as it is above EF far from the
surface. This condition occurs when
hs(inv.) = 2hF = 2kT
q
ln
Na ni
(6–15)­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 299
A surface potential of hF is required to bend the bands down to the intrinsic
condition at the surface (Ei = EF), and Ei must then be depressed another
qhF at the surface to obtain the condition we call strong inversion.
The electron and hole concentrations are related to the potential h(x)
defined in Fig. 6–13. Since the equilibrium electron concentration is
n0 = nie(EF - Ei)>kT = nie-qhF>kT (6–16)
we can easily relate the electron concentration at any x to this value:
n = nie-q(hF - h)>kT = n0eqh>kT (6–17)
and similarly for holes:
p0 = nieqhF>kT (6–18a)
p = p0e-qh>kT (6–18b)
at any x. We could combine these equations with Poisson’s equation (6–19)
and the usual charge density expression (6–20) to solve for h(x):

(6–17), and (6–18) for the electron and hole concentrations in Eqs. (6–19)

where we have introduced a new term, the Debye screening length,
LD = A Pqs2kT p0 (6–25)
The Debye length is a very important concept in semiconductors. It gives us an
idea of the distance scale in which charge imbalances are screened or smeared
out. For example, if we think of inserting a positively charged sphere in an ntype semiconductor we know that the mobile electrons will crowd around the
sphere. If we move away from the sphere by several Debye lengths, the positively charged sphere and the negative electron cloud will look like a neutral
entity. Not surprisingly, LD depends inversely on doping because the higher the
carrier concentration, the more easily screening takes place. For n-type material
we should use n0 in Eq. (6–25).
By using Gauss’s law at the surface, we can relate the integrated space
charge per unit area to the electric displacement, keeping in mind that the
electric field or displacement deep in the substrate is zero.

Fig. 6–14 that when the surface potential is zero (flat band conditions), the net
space charge is zero. This is because the fixed dopant charges are cancelled by
the mobile carrier charges at flat band. When the surface potential is negative,
it attracts and forms an accumulation layer of the majority carrier holes at the­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 301

potential. Since the band bending decreases as a function of depth, the integrated accumulation charge involves averaging over depth and introduces a
factor of 2 in the exponent. Mathematically, this is due to the square root in
Eq. (6–24). It must be noted that since this charge is due to the mobile majority carriers (holes in this case), the charge piles up near the oxide–silicon interface, since typical accumulation layer thicknesses are ∼ 20 nm. Also, because302 Chapter 6
of the exponential dependence of accumulation charge on surface potential,
the band bending is generally small or is said to be pinned to nearly zero.
On the other hand, for a positive surface potential, we see from Eq.
(6–24) that initially the second (linear) term is the dominant one. Although
the exponential term exp (qhs>kT) is very large, it is multiplied by the ratio
of the minority to majority carrier concentration which is very small, and
is initially negligible. Hence, the space charge for small positive surface
potentials increases as ∼ 2hs as shown in Fig. 6–14. As discussed in detail
later in this section, this corresponds to the depletion region charge due to
the exposed, fixed immobile dopants (acceptors in this case). The depletion
width typically extends over several hundred nm. At some point, the band
bending is twice the Fermi potential hF, which is enough for the onset of
strong inversion. Now, the exponential term exp (qhs(inv.)>kT) multiplied
by the minority carrier concentration n0 is equal to the majority carrier concentration p0. Hence, for band bending beyond this point, it becomes the
dominant term. As in the case of accumulation, the mobile inversion charge
now increases very strongly with bias, as indicated by Eq. (6–17) and shown
in Fig. 6–14. The typical inversion layer thicknesses are ∼5 nm, and the surface potential now is essentially pinned at 2hF.
It may be pointed out that in accumulation, and especially in inversion, the carriers are confined in the x-direction in narrow, essentially triangular potential wells, causing quantum mechanical particle-in-a-box states
or subbands, similar to those discussed in Chapter 2. However, the carriers
are free in the other directions (parallel to the oxide–silicon interface).
This leads to a two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) or hole gas, with
a “staircase” constant density of states, as discussed in Appendix IV. The
detailed analysis of these effects is, unfortunately, beyond the scope of our
discussion here.
The charge distribution, electric field, and electrostatic potential for the
inverted surface are sketched in Fig. 6–15. For simplicity we use the depletion approximation of Chapter 5 in this figure, assuming complete depletion for 0 6 x 6 W, and neutral material for x 7 W. In this approximation
the charge per unit area6 due to uncompensated acceptors in the depletion
region is -qNaW. The positive charge Qm on the metal is balanced by the
negative charge Qs in the semiconductor, which is the depletion layer charge
plus the charge due to the inversion region Qn:
Q
m = -Qs = qNaW - Qn (6–27)
The width of the inversion region is exaggerated in Fig. 6–15 for illustrative
purposes. Actually, the width of this region is generally less than 100 Å. Thus
we have neglected it in sketching the electric field and potential distribution. In the potential distribution diagram we see that an applied voltage V

appears partially across the insulator (Vi) and partially across the depletion
region of the semiconductor (hs):
V = Vi + hs (6–28)
The voltage across the insulator is obviously related to the charge on either
side, divided by the capacitance:
Vi =
-Q
sd
Pi
=
-Q
s
Ci (6–29)
where Pi is permittivity of the insulator and Ci is the insulator capacitance
per unit area. The charge Qs will be negative for the n channel, giving a positive Vi.
Using the depletion approximation, we can solve for W as a function
of hs (Prob. 6.7). The result is the same as would be obtained for an n+-p
junction in Chapter 5, for which the depletion region extends almost entirely
into the p region:
W = c 2qN Pshas d 1>2 (6–30)
This depletion region grows with increased voltage across the capacitor until
strong inversion is reached. After that, further increases in voltage result in
stronger inversion rather than in more depletion. Thus the maximum value
of the depletion width is
Wm
= c 2PshqN s(inv.) a d 1>2 = 2c PskT ln( q2NNa a>ni) d 1>2 (6–31)
using Eq. (6–15). We know the quantities in this expression, so Wm can be
calculated.
The charge per unit area in the depletion region Qd at strong inversion
is7
Qd = -qNaWm = -2(PsqNahF)1/2 (6–32)
The applied voltage must be large enough to create this depletion charge
plus the surface potential hs (inv.). The threshold voltage required for strong
inversion, using Eqs. (6–15), (6–28), and (6–29), is
VT = -
Qd
Ci + 2hF (ideal case) (6–33)
This assumes the negative charge at the semiconductor surface Qs at inversion
is mostly due to the depletion charge Qd. The threshold voltage represents the
minimum voltage required to achieve strong inversion, and is an extremely
important quantity for MOS transistors. We will see in the next section that
other terms must be added to this expression for real MOS structures.

The capacitance–voltage characteristics of this ideal MOS structure
(Fig. 6–16) vary depending on whether the semiconductor surface is in accumulation, depletion, or inversion.
Since the capacitance for MOSFETs is voltage dependent, we must
use the more general expression in Eq. (5–55) for the voltage-dependent
semiconductor capacitance,
C
s =
dQ
dV =
dQ
s
dhs (6–34)
Actually, if one looks at the electrical equivalent circuit of a MOS capacitor
or MOSFET, it is the series combination of a fixed, voltage-independent
gate oxide (insulator) capacitance, and a voltage-dependent semiconductor
capacitance [defined according to Eq. (6–34)], such that the overall MOS
capacitance becomes voltage dependent. The semiconductor capacitance
itself can be determined from the slope of the Qs vs. hs plot (Fig. 6–14). It
is clear that the semiconductor capacitance in accumulation is very high
because the slope is so steep; that is, the accumulation charge changes a lot
with surface potential. Hence, the series capacitance in accumulation is basically the insulator capacitance, Ci. Since, for negative voltage, holes are accumulated at the surface (Fig. 6–12b), the MOS structure appears almost like
a parallel-plate capacitor, dominated by the insulator properties Ci = Pi/d
(point 1 in Fig. 6–16). As the voltage becomes less negative, the semiconductor surface is depleted. Thus a depletion-layer capacitance Cd is added in
series with Ci:

where P
s is the semiconductor permittivity and W is the width of the depletion layer from Eq. (6–30). The total capacitance is
C = CiCd
Ci + Cd (6–36)
The capacitance decreases as W grows from flat band (point 2), past
weak inversion (point 3), until finally strong inversion is reached at VT
(point 4). In the depletion region, the small signal semiconductor capacitance
is given by the same formula [Eq. (6–34)] which gives the variation of the
(depletion) space charge with surface potential. Since the charge increases as
∼2hs, the depletion capacitance will obviously decrease as 1> 2hs, exactly
as for the depletion capacitance of a p-n junction [see Eq. (5–63)].
After inversion is reached, the small signal capacitance depends on
whether the measurements are made at high (typically ∼1 MHz) or low (typically ∼1-100 Hz) frequency, where “high” and “low” are with respect to
the generation–recombination rate of the minority carriers in the inversion
layer. If the gate voltage is varied rapidly, the charge in the inversion layer
cannot change in response, and thus does not contribute to the small signal
a-c capacitance. Hence, the semiconductor capacitance is at a minimum, corresponding to a maximum depletion width.
On the other hand, if the gate bias is changed slowly, there is time for
minority carriers to be generated in the bulk, drift across the depletion region
to the inversion layer, or go back to the substrate and recombine. Now, the
semiconductor capacitance, using the same Eq. (6–34), is very large because
we saw in Fig. 6–14 that the inversion charge increases exponentially with hs.
Hence, the low frequency MOS series capacitance in strong inversion is basically Ci once again (point 5).
What is the frequency dependence of the capacitance in accumulation
(Fig. 6–12a)? We get a very high capacitance both at low and high frequencies because the majority carriers in the accumulation layer can respond
much faster than minority carriers. While minority carriers respond on the
time scale of generation–recombination times (typically hundreds of microseconds in Si), majority carriers respond on the time scale of the dielectric
relaxation time, tD = tP, where t is the resistivity and P is the permittivity. tD is analogous to the RC time constant of a system, and is small for the
majority carriers (∼10-13 s). As an interesting aside, it may be pointed out
that in inversion, although the high-frequency capacitance for MOS capacitors is low, it is high (= Ci) for MOSFETs because now the inversion charge
can flow in readily and very fast (∼tD) from the source/drain regions rather
than having to be created by generation–recombination in the bulk.
6.4.3 Effects of real surfaces
When MOS devices are made using typical materials (e.g., metal@high@
k>SiO2-Si), departures from the ideal case described in the previous section
can strongly affect VT and other properties. First, there is a work function­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 307
difference between the metal gate and substrate, which depends on the
substrate doping. Second, there are inevitably charges at the Si­high­k/SiO2
interface and within the oxide which must be taken into account.
Work Function difference. We expect Φs to vary depending on the doping of the
semiconductor. Figure 6–17 illustrates the work function potential difference
Φ
ms = Φm - Φs for n+ polysilicon on Si as the doping is varied. For other
metal electrodes, the work function of that metal, Φm, must be used. We note
that Φ
ms is always negative for this case, and is most negative for heavily
doped p-type Si (i.e., for EF close to the valence band).
If we try to construct an equilibrium diagram with Φms negative
(Fig. 6–18a), we find that in aligning EF we must include a tilt in the oxide
conduction band (implying an electric field). Thus the metal is positively
charged and the semiconductor surface is negatively charged at equilibrium,
to accommodate the work function difference. As a result, the bands bend
down near the semiconductor surface. In fact, if Φms is sufficiently negative,
an inversion region can exist with no external voltage applied. To obtain the
flat band condition pictured in Fig. 6–18b, we must apply a negative voltage
to the metal (VFB = Φms).
interface charge. In addition to the work function difference, the equilibrium
MOS structure is affected by charges in the insulator and at the semiconductor–
oxide interface (Fig. 6–19). For example, alkali metal ions (particularly Na+)
can be incorporated inadvertently in the oxide during growth or subsequent
processing steps. Since sodium is a common contaminant, it is necessary to
use extremely clean chemicals, water, gases, and processing environment
to minimize its effect on dielectric layers. Sodium ions introduce positive
charges (Qm) in the oxide, which in turn induce negative charges in the
semiconductor. The effect of such positive ionic charges in the oxide depends

upon the number of ions involved and their distance from the semiconductor
surface (Prob. 6.14). The negative charge induced in the semiconductor is
greater if the Na+ ions are near the interface than if they are farther away. The
effect of this ionic charge on threshold voltage is complicated by the fact that
Na+ ions are relatively mobile in SiO2, particularly at elevated temperatures,
and can thus drift in an applied electric field. Obviously, a device with VT
dependent on its past history of voltage bias is unacceptable. Fortunately,
Na contamination of the oxide can be reduced to tolerable levels by proper
care in processing. The oxide also contains trapped charges (Qot) due to
imperfections in the SiO2.

In addition to oxide charges, a set of positive charges arises from interface states at the Si-SiO2 interface. These charges, which we will call Qit,
result from the sudden termination of the semiconductor crystal lattice at
the oxide interface. Near the interface is a transition layer (SiOx) containing
fixed charges (Qf). As oxidation takes place in forming the SiO2 layer, Si is
removed from the surface and reacts with the oxygen. When the oxidation
is stopped, some ionic Si is left near the interface. These ions, along with
uncompleted Si bonds at the surface, result in a sheet of positive charge
Q
f near the interface. This charge depends on oxidation rate and subsequent heat treatment, and also on crystal orientation. For carefully treated
Si-SiO2 interfaces, typical charge densities due to Qit and Qf are about
1010 charges/cm2 for samples with {100} surfaces. The interface charge density is about a factor of ten higher on {111} surfaces. That is why MOS devices
are generally made on {100} Si.
For simplicity we will include the various oxide and interface charges
in an effective positive charge at the interface Qi(C/cm2). The effect of this
charge is to induce an equivalent negative charge in the semiconductor. Thus
an additional component must be added to the flat band voltage:
VFB = Φms -
Qi
Ci (6–37)
Since the difference in work function and the positive interface charge both
tend to bend the bands down at the semiconductor surface, a negative voltage must be applied to the metal relative to the semiconductor to achieve
the flat band condition of Fig. 6–19b.
6.4.4 Threshold voltage
The voltage required to achieve flat band should be added to the threshold
voltage equation (6–33) obtained for the ideal MOS structure (for which we
assumed a zero flat band voltage):
VT = Φms -
Qi
Ci -
Qd
Ci + 2hF (6–38)
Thus the voltage required to create strong inversion must be large enough
to first achieve the flat band condition (Φms and Qi/Ci terms), then accommodate the charge in the depletion region (Qd/Ci), and finally to induce the
inverted region (2hF). This equation accounts for the dominant threshold voltage effects in typical MOS devices. It can be used for both n-type and p-type
substrates8 if appropriate signs are included for each term (Fig.6–20).Typically
Φ
ms is negative, although its value varies as in Fig. 6–17. The interface charge
is positive, so the contribution of the -Qi/Ci term is negative for either substrate type. On the other hand, the charge in the depletion region is negative
for ionized acceptors (p-type substrate, n-channel device) and is positive for
8It Fn Fmptrtaat tt remember that ad ehaaaee levFeen are male ta pdtype nubntraten aal that pd ehaaaee
levFeen have adtype nubntraten.310 Chapter 6
ionized donors (n-type substrate, p channel). Also, the term hF, which is defined
as (Ei - EF)>q in the neutral substrate, can be positive or negative, depending
on the conductivity type of the substrate. Considering the signs in Fig. 6–20, we
see that all four terms give negative contributions in the p-channel case. Thus
we expect negative threshold voltages for typical p-channel devices. On the
other hand, n-channel devices may have either positive or negative threshold
voltages, depending on the relative values of terms in Eq. (6–38).
All terms in Eq. (6–38) except Qi/Ci depend on the doping in the substrate. The terms Φ
ms and hF have relatively small variations as EF is moved
up or down by the doping. Large changes can occur in Qd, which varies
with the square root of the doping impurity concentration as in Eq. (6–32).
We illustrate the variation of threshold voltage with substrate doping
in Fig. 6–20. As expected from Eq. (6–38), VT is always negative for the
p-channel case. In the n-channel case, the negative flat band voltage terms
can dominate for lightly doped p-type substrates, resulting in a negative
threshold voltage. However, for more heavily doped substrates, the increasing contribution of Na to the Qd term dominates, and VT becomes positive.
We should pause here and consider what positive or negative VT means
for the two cases. In a p-channel device we expect to apply a negative voltage
from metal to semiconductor in order to induce the positive charges in the

channel. In this case a negative threshold voltage means that the negative
voltage we apply must be larger than VT in order to achieve strong inversion. In the n-channel case we expect to apply a positive voltage to the metal
to induce the channel. Thus a positive value for VT means the applied voltage
must be larger than this threshold value to obtain strong inversion and a conducting n channel. On the other hand, a negative VT in this case means that
a channel exists at V = 0 due to the Φ
ms and Qi effects (Figs. 6–18 and 6–19),
and we must apply a negative voltage VT to turn the device off. Since lightly
doped substrates are desirable to maintain a high breakdown voltage for
the drain junction, Fig. 6–20 suggests that VT will be negative for n-channel
devices made by standard processing. This tendency for the formation of
depletion mode (normally on) n-channel transistors is a problem which must
be dealt with by special fabrication methods to be described in Section 6.5.5.
6.4.5 MOs capacitance–voltage analysis
Let us see how the various parameters of a MOS device such as insulator
thickness, substrate doping, and VT can be determined from the C–V characteristics (Fig. 6–21a). First, the shape of the C–V curve depends upon the

type of substrate doping. If the high-frequency capacitance is large for negative gate biases and small for positive biases, it is a p-type substrate, and vice
versa. From the low-frequency C–V curve for p-type material, as the gate bias
is made more positive (or less negative), the capacitance goes down slowly in
depletion and then rises rapidly in inversion. As a result, the low-frequency
C–V is not quite symmetric in shape. For n-type substrates, the C–V curves
would be the mirror image of Fig. 6–21.
The capacitance Ci = Pi/d in accumulation or strong inversion (at low
frequencies) gives us the insulator thickness, d. The minimum MOS capacitance,Cmin, is the series combination of Ci and the minimum depletion capacitance, Cdmin = Ps/Wm, corresponding to the maximum depletion width. We
can in principle use the measurement of Cmin to determine the substrate
doping. However, from Eq. (6–31) we see that the dependence of Wm on Na is
complicated, and we get a transcendental equation which can only be solved
numerically. Actually, an approximate, iterative solution exists which gives us
Na
in terms of the minimum depletion capacitance, Cdmin.
Na
= 10[30.388 + 1.683 log Cdmin - 0.03177(log Cdmin)2] (6–39)
where Cdminis in F/cm2.
Once the substrate doping is obtained, we can determine the flat band
capacitance from it. It can be shown that the semiconductor capacitance at
flat band CFB (point 2 in Fig. 6–16) is determined from the Debye length
capacitance
C
debye =
P
s
LD
(6–40)
where the Debye length is dependent on doping as described in Eq. (6–25).
The overall MOS flat band capacitance, CFB, is the series combination of
C
debye and Ci. We can thus determine VFB corresponding to the CFB. Once
Ci, VFB, and substrate doping are obtained, all terms in the VT expression
(Eq. 6–38) are known. Interestingly, the threshold voltage VT does not correspond to exactly the minimum of the C–V characteristics, Cmin, but a slightly
higher capacitance marked as point 4 in Fig. 6–16. In fact, it corresponds
to the series combination of Ci and 2Cdmin, rather than the series combination of Ci and Cdmin. The reason for this is that when we change the gate
bias around strong inversion, the change of charge in the semiconductor is
the sum of the change in depletion charge and the mobile inversion charge,
where the two are equal in magnitude at the onset of strong inversion.
We can also determine MOS parameters such as the fast interface
state density, Dit, and mobile ion charges, Qm, from C–V measurements
(Figs. 6–21b,c and 6–22). The term fast interface state refers to the fact that
these defects can change their charge state relatively fast in response to
changes of the gate bias. As the surface potential in a MOS device is varied, the fast interface states or traps in the band gap can move above or
below the Fermi level in response to the bias, because their positions relative
to the band edges are fixed (Fig. 6–21b). Keeping in mind the property of314 Chapter 6
the Fermi–Dirac distribution that energy levels below the Fermi level have a
high probability of occupancy by electrons, while levels above the Fermi level
tend to be empty, we see that a fast interface state moving above the Fermi
level would tend to give up its trapped electron to the semiconductor (or
equivalently capture a hole). Conversely, the same fast interface state below
the Fermi level captures an electron (or gives up a hole). It obviously makes
sense to talk in terms of electrons or holes, depending on which is the majority carrier in the semiconductor. Since charge storage results in capacitance,
the fast interface states give rise to a capacitance which is in parallel with the
depletion capacitance in the channel (and hence is additive), and this combination is in series with the insulator capacitance Ci. The fast interface states
can keep pace with low frequency variations of the gate bias (∼1-1000 Hz),
but not at extremely high frequencies (∼1 MHz). So the fast interface states
contribute to the low frequency capacitance CLF, but not the high-frequency
capacitance CHF. Clearly, from the difference between the two, we ought to

While the fast interface states can respond quickly to voltage changes,
the fixed oxide charges Qf, as the name implies, do not change their charge
state regardless of the gate bias or surface potential. As mentioned above,
the effect of these charges on the flat band and threshold voltage depends
not only on the number of charges but also their location relative to the
oxide–silicon interface (Fig. 6–22a). Hence, we must take a weighted sum of
these charges, counting charges closer to the oxide–silicon interface more
heavily than those that are farther away. This position dependence is the
basis of what is called the bias-temperature stress test for measuring the
mobile ion content, Qm. We heat up the MOS device to ∼200-300°C (to
make the ions more mobile) and apply a positive gate bias to generate a
field of ∼1 MV/cm within the oxide. After cooling the capacitor to room
temperature, the C–V characteristics are measured. We have seen how VFB
can be determined from the C–V curve, using Eq. (6–40) and Ci. VFB is
also given by Eq. (6–37). The positive bias repels positive mobile ions such
as Na+ to the oxide–silicon interface so that they contribute fully to a flat
band voltage we can call VFB + . Next, the capacitor is heated up again, a negative bias is applied so that the ions drift to the gate electrode, and another
C–V measurement is made. Now, the mobile ions are too far away to affect
the semiconductor band bending, but induce an equal and opposite charge
on the gate electrode. From the resulting C–V, the new flat band, V FB - ,
is determined. From the difference of the two flat band voltages, we can
determine the mobile ion content using
Qm = Ci(VFB - - VFB + ) (6–42)
6.4.6 Time-dependent capacitance Measurements
During C–V measurements, if the gate bias is varied rapidly from accumulation to inversion, the depletion width can momentarily become greater
than the theoretical maximum for gate biases beyond VT. This phenomenon is known as deep depletion, and causes the MOS capacitance to drop
below the theoretical minimum, Cmin, for a transient period. After a time
period characteristic of the minority carrier lifetime, which determines the
rate of generation of the minority carriers in the MOS device, the depletion width collapses back to the theoretical maximum and the capacitance
recovers to Cmin (Fig. 6–23).This capacitance transient, C–t, forms the basis
of a powerful technique to measure the lifetime, known as the Zerbst
technique.316 Chapter 6
6.4.7 current–voltage characteristics of MOs Gate Oxides
An ideal gate insulator does not conduct any current, but for real insulators there can be some leakage current which varies with the voltage or
electric field across the gate oxide. By looking at the band diagram of the
MOS system perpendicular to the oxide–silicon interface (Fig. 6–24), we see
that for electrons in the conduction band, there is a barrier, ∆Ec (= 3.1 eV).
Although electrons with energy less than this barrier cannot go through the
oxide classically, it was discussed in Chapter 2 that quantum mechanically
electrons can tunnel through a barrier, especially if the barrier thickness is
sufficiently small. The detailed calculation of the Fowler–Nordheim tunneling
current for electrons going from the Si conduction band to the conduction
band of SiO2, and then having the electrons “hop” along in the oxide to the
gate electrode, involves solving the Schrödinger equation for the electron
wavefunction. The Fowler–Nordheim tunneling current IFN can be expressed
as a function of the electric field in the gate oxide:
IFN ∝ ℰ2 ox exp a ℰ-ox B b (6–43)
where B is a constant depending on m* n and the barrier height.

As gate oxides are made thinner in successive generations of MOSFETs,
the tunneling barrier in the gate oxide becomes so thin that the electrons
in the conduction band of Si can tunnel through the gate oxide and emerge in
the gate, without having to go via the conduction band of the gate oxide. This
is known as direct tunneling rather than Fowler–Nordheim tunneling. The
overall physics is similar, but some of the details are different. For instance,
Fowler–Nordheim tunneling involves a triangular barrier, while direct tunneling is through a trapezoidal barrier (Fig. 6–24a). Such tunneling currents
are becoming a major problem in modern devices because the useful feature
of high input impedance for MOS devices is degraded.
It is necessary to increase the gate capacitance in successive generations of MOSFETs in order to increase the drain current, as discussed later in
Section 6.5. One can achieve higher Ci by using insulators with a dielectric constant higher than SiO2 instead of reducing the gate oxide thickness, d, as can
be seen from Eq. (6–29). The advantage of not reducing d too much is that it
keeps the tunneling barrier wide, and the gate oxide field low, thereby keeping
the gate tunneling leakage current low [Eq. (6–43)]. Such high dielectric constant insulators such as hafnium dioxide, HfO2, are also known as high-k gate
dielectrics because k is also sometimes used as a symbol for dielectric constant.
Prolonged charge transport through gate oxides can ultimately cause
catastrophic electrical breakdown of the oxides. This is known as TimeDependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB). One of the popular models that
explains this degradation involves electrons tunneling into the conduction
band of the gate oxide from the negative electrode (cathode), then gaining
energy from the electric field, thus becoming “hot” electrons in the gate
oxide. If they gain sufficient energy, they can cause impact ionization within
the oxide and create electron–hole pairs (EHPs). The electrons are accelerated toward the (positive) Si substrate, while the holes travel toward the
gate. However, electron and hole mobilities are extremely small in SiO2.
Hole mobilities are particularly low (∼0.01 cm2/Vs). Hence, there is a great
propensity for these impact-generated holes to be trapped at defect sites
within the oxide, near the cathode. The resulting band diagram (Fig. 6–25)
is altered by this sheet of trapped positive charge, which causes the internal
electric field between this point and the gate to increase. A similar distortion of the electric field near the Si anode is created by the trapped impactgenerated electrons. However, the steepest slope in Fig. 6–25, and therefore
the highest field, is near the gate. As a result, the barrier for electron tunneling from the gate into the oxide is reduced. More electrons can tunnel
into the oxide, and cause more impact ionization. We get a positive feedback
effect that can lead to a runaway TDDB process.
With high-k gate dielectrics, other degradation mechanisms occur,
such as Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) in PMOSFETs. The
negative gate voltage that must be applied to turn the PMOSFET on causes
breakage of Si-H bonds near the gate dielectric interface and hole trapping
in the gate dielectric. Similarly, one can have PBTI in NMOSFETs, although
those effects are experimentally found to be less severe.­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 319

The MOS transistor is also called a surface field-effect transistor, since it
depends on control of current through a thin channel at the surface of the
semiconductor (Fig. 6–10). When an inversion region is formed under the
gate, current can flow from drain to source (for an n-channel device). In this
section we analyze the conductance of this channel and find the ID - VD
characteristics as a function of gate voltage VG. As in the JFET case, we
will find these characteristics below saturation and then assume ID remains
essentially constant above saturation.
6.5.1 Output characteristics
The applied gate voltage VG is accounted for by Eq. (6–28) plus the voltage
required to achieve flat band:
VG = VFB -

The induced charge Qs in the semiconductor is composed of mobile
charge Qn and fixed charge in the depletion region Qd. Substituting
Q
n + Qd for Qs, we can solve for the mobile charge:
Q
n = -Cic VG - aVFB + hs - QCdi b d (6–45)
At threshold the term in brackets can be written VG - VT from Eq. (6–38).
With a voltage VD applied, there is a voltage rise Vx from the source
to each point x in the channel. Thus the potential hs(x) is that required to
achieve strong inversion (2hF) plus the voltage Vx:
Q
n = -Cic VG - VFB - 2hF - Vx - C1i 22q PsNa(2hF + Vx) d (6–46)
If we neglect the variation of Qd(x) with bias Vx, Eq. (6–46) can be simplified to
Q
n(x) = -Ci( VG - VT - Vx) (6–47)
This equation describes the mobile charge in the channel at point x (Fig.6–26).
The conductance of the differential element dx is onQn(x)Z>dx, where Z
is the width of the channel and on is a surface electron mobility (indicating
the mobility in a thin region near the surface is not the same as in the bulk
material). At point x we have

In this analysis the depletion charge Qd in the threshold voltage VT
is simply the value with no drain current. This is an approximation, since
Qd(x) varies considerably when VD is applied, to reflect the variation in Vx
(see Fig. 6–26b). However, Eq. (6–49) is a fairly accurate description of drain
current for low values of VD, and is often used in approximate design calculations because of its simplicity. A more accurate and general expression is
obtained by including the variation of Qd(x). Performing the integration of
Eq. (6–48) using Eq. (6–46) for Qn(x), one obtains

The drain characteristics that result from these questions are shown in
Fig. 6–10c. If the gate voltage is above threshold (VG 7 VT), the drain current is described by Eq. (6–50) or approximately by Eq. (6–49) for low VD.
Initially the channel appears as an essentially linear resistor, dependent
on VG. The conductance of the channel in this linear region can be obtained
from Eq. (6–49) with VD ⪡ (VG - VT):

where VG 7 VT for a channel to exist.
As the drain voltage is increased, the voltage across the oxide decreases
near the drain, and Qn becomes smaller there. As a result the channel
becomes pinched off at the drain end, and the current saturates. The saturation condition is approximately given by
VD(sat.) _ VG - VT (6–52)322 Chapter 6
The drain current at saturation remains essentially constant for larger values
of drain voltage. Substituting Eq. (6–52) into Eq. (6–49), we obtain

The derivations presented here are based on the n-channel device. For
the p-channel enhancement transistor the voltages VD, VG, and VT are negative, and current flows from source to drain (Fig. 6–27).
6.5.2 Transfer characteristics
The output characteristics plot the drain current as a function of the drain
bias, with gate bias as a parameter (Fig. 6–27). On the other hand, the transfer
characteristics plot the output drain current as a function of the input gate
bias, for fixed drain bias (Fig. 6–28a). Clearly, in the linear region, ID vs. VG
should be a straight line from Eq. (6–49).The intercept of this line on the VG

axis is the linear region threshold voltage, VT(lin.), and the slope (divided
by the applied VD) gives us the linear value of kN, kN (lin.), of the n-channel
MOSFET. If we look at actual data, however, we see that while the characteristics are approximately linear at low gate bias, at high gate biases the drain
current increases sub-linearly. The transconductance, gm(lin.), in the linear
region can be obtained by differentiating the right-hand side of Eq. (6–49) with
respect to gate bias. The gm (lin.) is plotted as a function of VG in Fig. 6–28b.
It may be noted that the transconductance is zero below VT because there is
little drain current. It goes through a maximum at the point of inflection of
the ID - VG curve, and then decreases. This decrease is due to two factors
that will be discussed in Sections 6.5.3 and 6.5.8: degradation of the effective
channel mobility as a function of increasing transverse electric field across
the gate oxide, and source/drain series resistance.
For the transfer characteristics in the saturation region, since Eq. (6–53)

in the saturation region, VT(sat.). We shall see in Section 6.5.10 that due to
effects such as drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), for short channel
length MOSFETs the VT (sat.) can be lower than VT (lin.), while the long
channel values are similar. Similarly, the slope of the transfer characteristics
can be used to determine the value of kN in the saturation region, kN(sat.)

6.5.3 Mobility Models
The mobility of carriers in the channel of a MOSFET is lower than in bulk
semiconductors because there are additional scattering mechanisms. Since
carriers in the channel are very close to the semiconductor–oxide interface,
they are scattered by surface roughness and by coulombic interaction with
fixed charges in the gate oxide. When the carriers travel in the inversion layer
from the source to the drain, they encounter microscopic roughness on an
atomistic scale at the oxide–silicon interface and undergo scattering because,
as discussed in Section 3.4.1, any deviation from a perfectly periodic crystal
potential results in scattering. This mobility degradation increases with the
gate bias because a higher gate bias draws the carriers closer to the oxide–
silicon interface, where they are more influenced by the interfacial roughness.
It is very interesting to note that if we plot the effective carrier mobility
in the MOSFET as a function of the average transverse electric field in the
middle of the inversion layer, we get what is known as a “universal” mobility
degradation curve for any MOSFET, which is independent of the technology
or device structural parameters such as oxide thickness and channel doping
(Fig. 6–30). We can apply Gauss’s law to the region marked by the colored

middle of the inversion region is given by

eff =

aQd + 1 2Qnb (6–55a)
While this model works quite well for electrons, for reasons that are not
clearly understood at present, it has to be modified slightly for holes in the
sense that the average transverse field must now be defined as
ℰ
eff =
1 Ps

This degradation of mobility with gate bias is often compactly described by
writing the drain current expression as
ID
=
mnZCi
L51 + u(VG - VT)6 c (VG - VT)VD - 1 2V2 D d (6–56)
where u is called the mobility degradation parameter. Because of the additional (VG - VT) term in the denominator, the drain current increases sublinearly with gate bias for high gate voltages.
In addition to this dependence of the channel mobility on gate bias or
transverse electric field, there is also a strong dependence on drain bias or
the longitudinal electric field. As shown in Fig. 3–24, the carrier drift velocity
increases linearly with electric field (ohmic behavior) until the field reaches
ℰsat; in other words, the mobility is constant up to ℰsat. After this, the velocity

effects can be described as:
v = oℰ for ℰ 6 ℰsat (6–57)
and v = v
s for ℰ 7 ℰsat (6–58)
The maximum longitudinal electric field near the drain end of the channel is approximately given by the voltage drop along the pinch-off region
(VD - VD(sat.)), divided by the length of the pinch-off region, ∆L:
ℰ
max = aVD - ∆VLD(sat.) b (6–59)
From a two-dimensional solution of the Poisson equation near the drain end,
one can show that the pinch-off region ∆L shown in Fig.6–11c is approximately
equal to 2(3dxj), where d is the gate oxide thickness and xj is the source/drain
junction depth. The factor of 3 is due to the ratio of the dielectric constant for
Si to that of SiO2.
6.5.4 short channel MOsFET I–V characteristics
In short channel devices, the analysis has to be somewhat modified. As mentioned in the previous section, the effective channel mobility decreases with
increasing transverse electric field perpendicular to the gate oxide (i.e., the
gate bias). Furthermore, for very high longitudinal electric fields in the pinchoff region, the carrier velocity saturates (Fig. 3–24). For short channel lengths,
the carriers travel at the saturation velocity over most of the channel. In that
case, the drain current is given by the width times the channel charge per unit
area times the saturation velocity:
ID
(sat.) ≈ ZCi(VG - VT) vs (6–60)
As a result, the saturation drain current does not increase quadratically
with (VG - VT) as shown in Eq. (6–53), but rather shows a linear dependence (note the equal spacing of curves in Fig. 6–32). Due to the advances
in Si device processing, particularly photolithography, MOSFETs used in
modern integrated circuits tend to have short channels, and are commonly
described by Eq. (6–60) rather than Eq. (6–53).
Current-generation nanoscale MOSFET channel lengths have been
scaled down so aggressively that we have entered a different regime of
operation where there are very few scattering events in the channel. This
is known as the ballistic or quasi-ballistic regime. [The terminology comes
from the analogy with launching electrons in the channel where they travel
unimpeded like ballistic missiles.] Under these conditions, the current is not
limited by velocity saturation (which is caused by optical phonon scattering)
in the pinch-off region near the drain, as described in Eq. (6–60). Instead,
the current is limited by how rapidly the carriers can be supplied by the328 Chapter 6
source. This is known as source-injection limited transport. Under these conditions, the drain current is given by
ID
(sat.) ≈ 5(1 - r)>(1 + r)6 ZCi(VG - VT) vinj (6–61)
where r is the reflection coefficient of the electron wavefunction near the top
of the channel potential barrier near the source (Fig. 6–33), and vinj is effective
source-injection velocity. vinj is related to the random thermal velocity, vth, of
the carriers in the source. At high carrier concentrations in the channel, vinj
approaches a higher velocity. vF, which is the velocity of the carriers near the
Fermi level. An analysis of the physics by Natori and Lundstrom has shown
that the backscattering or the reflection coefficient r is related to the low
field mobility in the channel. The higher the mobility, the longer is the mean
free path, leading to a lower r and higher source-injection-limited drain current. This model of transport of carriers in a nanoscale device treats electrons
being transmitted as waves in an electron waveguide, and is known as the
Landauer-Buttiker formalism. This is a powerful and different way of treating
transport in nanoscale devices where scattering is negligible, and the concept of mobility (which is determined by scattering) is suspect. The Landauer
approach treats conductance in terms of transmission of the electron waves.

6.5.5 control of Threshold voltage
Since the threshold voltage determines the requirements for turning the
MOS transistor on or off, it is very important to be able to adjust VT in
designing the device. For example, if the transistor is to be used in a circuit
driven by a 3-V battery, it is clear that a 4-V threshold voltage is unacceptable. Some applications require not only a low value of VT, but also a precisely controlled value to match other devices in the circuit.
All of the terms in Eq. (6–38) can be controlled to some extent. The
work function potential difference Φms is determined by choice of the gate
conductor material; 0F depends on the substrate doping; Qi can be reduced
by proper oxidation methods and by using Si grown in the (100) orientation;
Qd can be adjusted by doping of the substrate; and Ci depends on the thickness and dielectric constant of the insulator. We shall discuss here several
methods of controlling these quantities in device fabrication.
choice of Gate Electrode. Since VT depends on Φms, the choice of the gate
electrode material (i.e., the gate electrode work function) has an impact on

the threshold voltage. When MOSFETs were first made in the 1960s, they
used Al gates. However, since Al has a low melting point, it precluded the
use of a self-aligned source/drain technology because that required a high
temperature source/drain implant anneal after the gate formation. Hence,
Al was supplanted by n+ doped LPCVD polysilicon refractory (high
melting point) gates, where the Fermi level lines up with the conduction
band edge in Si. While this works quite well for n-channel MOSFETs,
we shall see in Section 9.3.1 that it can create problems for p-channel
MOSFETs. Therefore, sometimes, a p+ doped polysilicon gate is used for
p-channel devices. Refractory metal gates with suitable work functions
are now being used as replacements for doped polysilicon. One attractive
candidate is tungsten,whose work function is such that the Fermi level
happens to lie near the midgap of Si.
control of ci. Since a low value of VT and a high drive current is usually
desired, a thin oxide layer is used in the gate region to increase Ci = Pi/d in
Eq. (6–38). From Fig. 6–20 we see that increasing Ci makes VT less negative
for p-channel devices and less positive for n channel with -Qd 7 Qi.
For practical considerations, the high-k gate oxide thickness is generally
10-100 Å (1-10 nm) in modern devices having submicron gate length.
An example of such a device is shown in Fig. 6–34. The gate oxide, easily
observable in this micrograph, is high-k. The interfacial layer between the
crystalline silicon and the high-k is also observable.
Although a low threshold voltage is desirable in the gate region of a
transistor, a large value of VT is needed between devices. For example, if
a number of transistors are interconnected on a single Si chip, we do not
want inversion layers to be formed inadvertently between devices (generally
called the field). One way to avoid such parasitic channels is to increase VT
in the field by using a very thick oxide using STI. Figure 6–35 illustrates a
transistor with a gate oxide 10 nm thick and a field oxide of 0.5 mm.
Threshold adjustment by ion implantation. The most valuable tool for
controlling threshold voltage is ion implantation (Section 5.1.4). Since
very precise quantities of impurity can be introduced by this method, it
is possible to maintain close control of VT. The negatively charged boron
acceptors serve to reduce the effects of the positive depletion charge Qd.
As a result, VT becomes less negative. Similarly, a shallow boron implant
into the p-type substrate of an n-channel transistor can make VT positive, as
required for an enhancement device.
If the implantation is performed at higher energy, or into the bare Si
instead of through an oxide layer, the impurity distribution lies deeper below
the surface. In such cases the essentially gaussian impurity concentration profile
cannot be approximated by a spike at the Si surface. Therefore, effects of distributed charge on the Qd term of Eq. (6–38) must be considered. Calculations
of the effects on VT in this case are more complicated, and the shift of threshold voltage with implantation dose is often obtained empirically instead.­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 331
The implantation energy required for shallow VT adjustment implants
is low (50-100 keV), and relatively low doses are needed. A typical VT
adjustment requires only about 10 s of implantation for each wafer,
and therefore this procedure is compatible with large-scale production
requirements.
If the implantation is continued to higher doses, VT can be moved
past zero to the depletion-mode condition (Fig. 6–36). This capability provides considerable ﬂexibility to the integrated-circuit designer, by allowing
enhancement- and depletion-mode devices to be incorporated on the same
chip. For example, a depletion-mode transistor can be used instead of a resistor as a load element for the enhancement device. Thus an array of MOS
transistors can be fabricated in an IC layout, with some adjusted by implantation to have the desired enhancement-mode VT and others implanted to
become depletion loads.
As mentioned, VT control is important not only in the MOSFETs but
also in the isolation or field regions. In addition to using a thick field oxide,
we can do a channel stop implant (so called because it stops turning on a
parasitic channel in the isolation regions) selectively in the isolation regions
under the field oxide (Fig. 6–34). Generally, a B channel stop implant is used
for n-channel devices. (It must be noted that such an acceptor implant will

6.5.6 substrate bias Effects—the “body” Effect

that the source S was connected to the substrate B (Fig. 6–27). In fact, it­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 333
For a p-channel transistor with a gate oxide thickness of 10 nm, calculate the boron ion dose FB(B+ ions>cm2) required to reduce VT from
-1.1 V to - 0.5 V. Assume that the implanted acceptors form a sheet of
negative charge just below the Si surface. If, instead of a shallow B implant,
it was a much broader distribution, how would the VT calculation change?
Assuming a boron ion beam current of 10 - 5 A, and supposing that the
area scanned by the ion beam is 650 cm2, how long does this implant take?

Since the B negative ions are assumed to form a sheet of charge just sOLuTiOn
below the gate oxide, they affect the fixed oxide charge term in VFB. Thus,

If the B distribution is deeper, we cannot assume it to be a sheet
charge in VFB. If it is approximately constant over the maximum depletion width, we should instead change the substrate doping term in the
expression for VT. Otherwise, the calculation has to be done by numerically solving Poisson’s equation in the depletion region, with a varying
doping concentration corresponding to the B distribution, to obtain the
voltage drop in the semiconductor.

is possible to apply a voltage between S and B (Fig. 6–37). With a reverse
bias between the substrate and the source (VB negative for an n-channel
device), the source-channel junction potential barrier (Fig. 6–10b) is
increased. Clearly, the gate must be biased more positively than for the
grounded substrate, to lower the source-channel potential barrier sufficiently to create an inversion layer. This causes the threshold voltage to
increase with (reverse) substrate bias—this is known as the body effect. The
new VT is given by adding a voltage drop -VB between the gate and the
substrate (Fig. 6–37) to the 2hF term in the grounded substrate case, so that
Eq. (6–38) should be changed.334 Chapter 6

However, since the VT is defined not with respect to the substrate, but
rather with respect to the grounded source, we need to add the VB term at the
end, and the VB terms cancel out. The net result is that the depletion region
in the channel is widened and the threshold gate voltage required to achieve
inversion must be increased to accommodate the larger Q¿d.

is also proportional to 2Na. For a p-channel device the bulk-to-source­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 335

a marginally enhancement device (VT ∼ 0) to a somewhat larger and more
manageable value. This can be an asset for n-channel devices particularly
(see Fig. 6–20).The effect can present problems, however, in MOS integrated
circuits for which it is impractical to connect each source region to the substrate. In these cases, possible VT shifts due to the body effect must be taken
into account in the circuit design.
6.5.7 subthreshold characteristics
If we look at the drain current expression [Eq. (6–53)], it appears that the
current abruptly goes to zero as soon as VG is reduced to VT. In reality, there
is still some drain conduction below threshold, and this is known as subthreshold conduction. This current is due to weak inversion in the channel
between flat band and threshold (for band bending between zero and 2hF),
which leads to a diffusion current from source to drain. The drain current in
the subthreshold region is equal to

L akT q b 2a1 - e-kT qVD b aeq(VcGrkT - VT) b (6–65)
where
c
r = c 1 + Cd C+i Cit d
It can be seen that ID depends exponentially on gate bias, VG. However,
VD has little influence once VD exceeds a few kT>q. Obviously, if we plot
ln ID as a function of gate bias VG, we should get a linear behavior in the
subthreshold regime, as shown in Fig. 6–38a. The slope of this line (or more
precisely the reciprocal of the slope) is known as the subthreshold slope, S,
which has typical values of ∼70 mV/decade at room temperature for stateof-the-art MOSFETs. This means that a change in the input VG of 70 mV
will change the output ID by an order of magnitude. Clearly, the smaller the
value of S, the better the transistor is as a switch. A small value of S means a
small change in the input bias can modulate the output current considerably.
It can be shown that the expression for S is given by
S =

d(log ID) = ln 10

d(ln ID) = 2.3

q c 1 + Cd C+i Cit d (6–66)
Here, the factor ln 10 (= 2.3) is introduced to change from log10 to natural
logarithm, ln. This equation can be understood by looking at the electrical
equivalent circuit of the MOSFET in terms of the capacitors (Fig. 6–38b).
Between the gate and the substrate, we find the gate capacitance,Ci, in series
with the parallel combination of the depletion capacitance in the channel,
Cd, and the fast interface state capacitance, Cit = qDit. The expression in

what fraction of the applied gate bias, VG, appears at the Si-SiO2 interface
as the surface potential. Ultimately, it is the surface potential that is responsible for modulating the barrier between source and drain, and therefore the
drain current. Hence, S is a measure of the efficacy of the gate potential in
modulating ID. From Eq. (6–66), we observe that S is improved by reducing
the gate oxide thickness, which is reasonable because if the gate electrode is
closer to the channel, the gate control is obviously better. The value of S is
higher for heavy channel doping (which increases the depletion capacitance)
or if the silicon–oxide interface has many fast interface states.
For a very small gate voltage, the subthreshold current is reduced
to the leakage current of the source/drain junctions. This determines the
off-state leakage current, and therefore the standby power dissipation in
many complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits involving both n-channel and
p-channel MOSFETs. It also underlines the importance of having highquality source/drain junctions. From the subthreshold characteristics, it can
be seen that if the VT of a MOSFET is too low, it cannot be turned off fully at
VG = 0. Also, unavoidable statistical variations of VT cause drastic variations
of the subthreshold leakage current. On the other hand, if VT is too high, one
sacrifices drive current, which depends on the difference between the power
supply voltage and VT. For these reasons, the VT of MOSFETs has historically been designed to be ∼0.7 V. However, with the recent advent of various
types of low-voltage, low-power portable electronics, there are new challenges in device and circuit design to optimize speed and power dissipation.
6.5.8 Equivalent circuit for the MOsFET
When we attempt to draw an equivalent circuit of a MOSFET, we find that
in addition to the intrinsic MOSFET itself, there are a variety of parasitic
elements associated with it. An important addition to the gate capacitance is
the so-called Miller overlap capacitance due to the overlap between the gate
and the drain region (Fig. 6–39).This capacitance is particularly problematic
because it represents a feedback path between the output drain terminal
and the input gate terminal. One can measure the Miller capacitance at
high-frequency by holding the gate at ground (VG = 0) so that an inversion
layer is not formed in the channel. Thereby, most of the measured capacitance between gate and drain is due to the Miller capacitance, rather than
the gate capacitance Ci. It is possible to minimize this capacitance by using
a so-called self-aligned gate. In this process, the gate itself is used to mask
the source/drain implants, thereby achieving alignment. Even in this design,
however, there is still a certain amount of overlap because of the lateral
straggle or spread of the implanted dopants underneath the gate, further
exacerbated by the lateral diffusion which occurs during high temperature
annealing. This spread of the source/drain junctions under the gate edge
determines what is called the channel length reduction, ∆LR (Fig. 6–40).
Hence, we get the electrical or “effective” channel length, Leff, in terms of
the physical gate length, L as

There can also be a width reduction, ∆Z, which changes the effective width,
Z
eff, from the physical width Z of the MOSFET. The width reduction results
from the electrical isolation regions that are formed around all transistors, generally by LOCOS.The LOCOS isolation technique is discussed in Section 9.3.1.
Another very important parameter in the equivalent circuit is the
source/drain series resistance, RSD = (RS + RD), because it degrades the
drain current and transconductance. For a certain applied drain bias to
the source/drain terminals, part of the applied voltage is “wasted” as an
ohmic voltage drop across these resistances, depending on the drain current (or gate bias). Hence, the actual drain voltage applied to the intrinsic
MOSFET itself is less; this causes ID to increase sub-linearly with VG.
We can determine RSD, along with ∆LR, from the overall resistance of
the MOSFET in the linear region,
aVIDD b
This corresponds to the intrinsic channel impedance RCh, plus the sourcedrain resistance RSD. Modifying Eq. (6–51) we get

We can measure VD>ID in the linear range for various MOSFETs having
the same width, but different channel lengths, as a function of substrate
bias. Varying the substrate bias changes the VT through the body effect, and
therefore the slope of the straight lines that result from plotting the overall
resistance as a function of L. The lines pass through a point, having values
which correspond to ∆LR and RSD, as shown in Fig. 6–40.
6.5.9 MOsFET scaling and hot Electron Effects
Much of the progress in semiconductor integrated circuit technology can
be attributed to the ability to shrink or scale the devices. Scaling down
MOSFETs has a multitude of benefits. From Table 6–1, we see the benefits
of scaling in terms of the improvement of packing density, speed and power
dissipation. A key concept in scaling, first due to Dennard at IBM, is that
the various structural parameters of the MOSFET should be scaled in concert if the device is to keep functioning properly. In other words, if lateral
dimensions such as the channel length and width are reduced by a factor of
K, so should the vertical dimensions such as source/drain junction depths
(xj) and gate insulator thickness (Table 6–1). Scaling of depletion widths is
achieved indirectly by scaling up doping concentrations. However, if we simply reduced the dimensions of the device and kept the power supply voltages
the same, the internal electric fields in the device would increase. For ideal
scaling, power supply voltages should also be reduced to keep the internal
electric fields reasonably constant from one technology generation to the
next. Unfortunately, in practice, power supply voltages are not scaled handin-hand with the device dimensions, partly because of other system-related
constraints. The longitudinal electric fields in the pinch-off region, and the

transverse electric fields across the gate oxide, increase with MOSFET scaling. A variety of problems then arise which are generically known as hot
electron effects and short channel effects (Fig. 6–41).
When an electron travels from the source to the drain along the channel, it gains kinetic energy at the expense of electrostatic potential energy in
the pinch-off region, and becomes a “hot” electron. At the conduction band
edge, the electron has potential energy only; as it gains more kinetic energy, it
moves higher up in the conduction band. A few of the electrons can become
energetic enough to surmount the 3.1-eV potential barrier between the Si
channel and the gate oxide (Fig. 6–25). Some of these injected hot electrons can go through the gate oxide and be collected as gate current, thereby
reducing the input impedance. More importantly, some of these electrons can
be trapped in the gate oxide as fixed oxide charges. According to Eq. (6–37),
this increases the flat band voltage, and therefore the VT. In addition, these
energetic hot carriers can rupture Si–H bonds that exist at the Si-SiO2 interface, creating fast interface states that degrade MOSFET parameters such
as transconductance and subthreshold slope, with stress. The results of such
hot carrier degradation are shown in Fig. 6–42, where we see the increase
of VT and decrease of slope, and therefore transconductance, with stress.
The solution to this problem is to use what is known as a lightly doped drain
(LDD). As discussed in more detail in Section 9.3.1, by reducing the doping

concentration in the source/drain, the depletion width at the reverse-biased
drain-channel junction is increased and the electric field is reduced.
Hot carrier effects are less problematic for holes in p-channel MOSFETs
than for electrons in n-channel devices for two reasons. The channel mobility
of holes is approximately half that of electrons; hence, for the same electric
field, there are fewer hot holes than hot electrons. Unfortunately, the lower
hole mobility is also responsible for lower drive currents in p channel than in
n channel. Also, the barrier for hole injection in the valence band between Si
and SiO2 is higher (5 eV) than for electrons in the conduction band (3.1 eV),
as shown in Fig. 6–25. Hence, while LDD is mandatory for n channel, it is
often not used for p-channel devices.

One “signature” for hot electron effects is substrate current (Fig. 6–43).
As the electrons travel toward the drain and become hot, they can create secondary EHPs by impact ionization (Fig. 6–41). The secondary electrons are collected at the drain, and cause the drain current in saturation
to increase with drain bias at high voltages, thereby leading to a decrease
of the output impedance. The secondary holes are collected at the substrate as substrate current. This current can create circuit problems such
as noise or latchup in CMOS circuits (Section 9.3.1). It can also be used as
a monitor for hot electron effects. As shown in Fig. 6–43, substrate current
initially increases with gate bias (for a fixed, high drain bias), goes through a
peak, and then decreases. The reason for this behavior is that initially, as the
gate bias increases, the drain current increases and thereby provides more

primary carriers into the pinch-off region for impact ionization. However,
for even higher gate bias, the MOSFET goes from the saturation region into
the linear region when the fixed VD drops below VD(sat.) = (VG - VT).
The longitudinal electric field in the pinch-off region drops, thereby reducing the impact ionization rates. Hot electron reliability studies are done
under “worst case” conditions of peak substrate current. These are generally
done under accelerated conditions of higher-than-normal operating voltages so that if there are any potential problems, they show up in a reasonable time period. The degradation data is then extrapolated to the actual
operating conditions.
6.5.10 drain-induced barrier Lowering
If small channel length MOSFETs are not scaled properly, and the
source/drain junctions are too deep or the channel doping is too low, there
can be unintended electrostatic interactions between the source and the
drain known as Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL). This leads to
punch-through leakage or breakdown between the source and the drain,
and loss of gate control. The phenomenon can be understood from Fig. 6–44,
where we have schematically plotted the surface potential along the channel
for a long channel device and a short device. We see that as the drain bias is
increased, the conduction band edge (which reflects the electron energies) in
the drain is pulled down, and the drain-channel depletion width expands. For
a long channel MOSFET, the drain bias does not affect the source-to-channel
potential barrier, which corresponds to the built-in potential of the sourcechannel p-n junction. Hence, unless the gate bias is increased to lower this
potential barrier, there is little drain current. On the other hand, for a short
channel MOSFET, as the drain bias is raised and the conduction band edge in
the drain is pulled down (with a concomitant increase of the drain depletion
width), the source-channel potential barrier is lowered due to DIBL. This
can be shown numerically by a solution of the two-dimensional Poisson’
equation in the channel region. The physics can be captured by an equivalent
circuit which shows the gate capacitance, Ci and a drain capacitance Cdr competing for control of the channel potential near the source end (Fig. 6–33).
Simplistically, the onset of DIBL is sometimes considered to correspond to
the drain depletion region expanding and merging with the source depletion region, and causing punch-through breakdown between source and
drain. However, it must be kept in mind that DIBL is ultimately caused
by the lowering of the source-junction potential barrier below the built-in
potential. Hence, if we get DIBL in a MOSFET for a grounded substrate, the
problem can be mitigated by applying a substrate reverse bias, because that
raises the potential barrier at the source end. This works in spite of the fact
that the drain depletion region interacts even more with the source depletion
region under such back bias. Once the source-channel barrier is lowered by
DIBL, there can be significant drain leakage current, with the gate being
unable to shut it off.346 Chapter 6
What are the solutions to this problem? The source/drain junctions
must be made sufficiently shallow (i.e., scaled properly) as the channel
lengths are reduced, to prevent DIBL. Secondly, the channel doping must
be made sufficiently high to prevent the drain from being able to control the
source junction. This is achieved by performing what is known as an antipunch-through implant in the channel. Sometimes, instead of such an implant
throughout the channel (which can have undesirable consequences such as
raising the VT or the body effect), a localized implant is done only near the
source/drains. These are known as halo or pocket implants. The higher doping reduces the source/drain depletion widths and prevents their interaction.

For short channel MOSFETs, DIBL is related to the electrical modulation of the channel length in the pinch-off region, ∆L. Since the drain current
is inversely proportional to the electrical channel length, we get

for small pinch-off regions, ∆L. We assume that the fractional change in the
channel length is proportional to the drain bias,

= lVD (6–70)
where l is the channel length modulation parameter. Hence, in the saturation
region, the expression for the drain current becomes

This leads to a slope in the output characteristics, or a lowering of the output
impedance (Fig. 6–32).
6.5.11 short channel Effect and narrow Width Effect
If we plot the threshold voltage as a function of channel length in
MOSFETs, we find that VT decreases with L for very small geometries. This
effect is called the short channel effect (SCE), and is somewhat similar to
DIBL. The mechanism is due to something called charge sharing between
the source/drain and the gate (Fig. 6–45).9 From the equation for the

threshold voltage (6–38), we notice that one of the terms is the depletion
charge under the gate.
The equipotential lines in Fig. 6–45 designating the depletion regions
curve around the contours of the source/drain junctions. Keeping in mind
that the electric field lines are perpendicular to the equipotential contours,
we see that the depletion charges that are physically underneath the gate in
the approximately triangular regions near the source/drains have their field
lines terminate not on the gate, but instead on the source/drains. Hence,
electrically these depletion charges are “shared” with the source and drain
regions and should not be counted in the VT expression, Eq. (6–38). We can
deal with this effect by replacing the orginal Qd in the rectangular region
underneath the gate by a lower Qd in the trapezoidal region in Fig. 6–45.
Clearly, for a long channel device, the triangular depletion charge regions
near the source and drain are a very small fraction of the total depletion
charge underneath the gate. However, as the channel lengths are reduced,
the shared charge becomes a larger fraction of the total, and this results in a
VT roll-off as a function of L (Fig. 6–46). This is important because it is hard
to control the channel lengths precisely in manufacturing. The channel length
variations then lead to problems with VT control.
In the last several years, another effect has been observed in n-channel
MOSFETs with decreasing L. The VT initially goes up before it goes down
due to the short channel effect. This phenomenon has been dubbed the
reverse short channel effect (RSCE), and is due to interactions between Si
point defects that are created during the source/drain implant and the B
doping in the channel, causing the B to pile up near the source and drains,
and thus raise the VT.
Another related effect in MOSFETs is the narrow width effect, where
the VT goes up as the channel width Z is reduced for very narrow devices
(Fig. 6–46).This can be understood from Fig. 6–47, where some of the depletion charges under the LOCOS isolation regions have field lines electrically terminating on the gate. Unlike the SCE, where the effective depletion

charge is reduced due to charge sharing with the source/drain, here the
depletion charge belonging to the gate is increased. The effect is not important for very wide devices, but becomes quite important as the widths are
reduced below 1 om.
6.5.12 Gate-induced drain Leakage
If we examine the subthreshold characteristics shown in Fig. 6–38, we find
that as the gate voltage is reduced below VT, the subthreshold current drops
and then bottoms out at a level determined by the source/drain diode leakage. However, for even more negative gate biases we find that the off-state
leakage current actually goes up as we try to turn off the MOSFET more for
high VD; this is known as gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL). The same effect
is seen at a fixed gate bias of near zero, for increasing drain bias. The reason
for GIDL can be understood from Fig. 6–48, where we show the band diagram as a function of depth in the region where the gate overlaps the drain
junction. As the gate is made more negative (or alternatively, for a fixed
gate bias, the drain is made more positive), a depletion region forms in the
n-type drain. Since the drain doping is high, the depletion widths tend to be
narrow. If the band bending is more than the band gap Eg across a narrow
depletion region, the conditions are conducive to band-to-band tunneling
in this region, thereby creating EHPs. The electrons then go to the drain as
GIDL. It must be emphasized that this tunneling is not through the gate
oxide (Section 6.4.7), but entirely in the Si drain region. For GIDL to occur,
the drain doping level should be moderate (∼1018 cm-3). If it is much lower
than this, the depletion widths and tunneling barriers are too wide. On the
other hand, if the doping in the drain is very high, most of the voltage drops
in the gate oxide, and the band bending in the Si drain region drops below

6.6.1 Metal Gate-high-k
As described above, the Si MOSFET with thermally grown SiO2 gate dielectric with its high-quality interface, and heavily doped polysilicon gate electrode has been the workhorse in this field for decades. However, due to the
problems of tunneling leakage currents in ultra-thin SiO2 gate dielectrics,
in recent years there has been a shift to high-k gate dielectrics such as HfO2
which can be made physically thicker without sacrificing gate capacitance,
Ci = Pi>d. Generally, higher dielectric constant materials have lower band
gaps than SiO2. Hence, the band offsets in the conduction and valence bands
may also be lower between these high-k gate dielectrics and Si. Thus, while­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 351
the gate dielectric tunnel barriers may be wider, the heights of the barriers may be lower than for SiO2 on Si. Another complication is that the
electrical interfaces between the high-k dielectrics and Si are worse than
between thermally grown SiO2 and Si, leading to degraded channel mobilities. Hence, it is common to grow a thin interfacial SiO2 layer between the
high-k dielectric and the Si channel in order to recover the high effective
channel mobilities.
A common technique for deposition of such high-k dielectrics is atomic
layer deposition (ALD). Atomic layer deposition is a type of CVD where one
alternately cycles in a self-limiting fashion between two types of gas precursors that are needed to grow the material. For instance, to grow hafnia (HfO2),
in one cycle we saturate the Si surface with a monolayer of a Hf-containing
precursor, after which the precursor will not adsorb under the selected conditions of susbtrate temperature and gas pressure. We flush out the Hf precursor, and flow in the oxygen-containing precursor (H2O) which will complete
the growth of a monolayer of HfO2. Then, we go to the next cycle by flushing
out the H2O, and flowing in the HF precursor. Thus, we achieve digital control over the layer thicknesses where the growth depends on the number of
the growth cycles rather than the growth time, as in conventional CVD. Such
control is particuarly important for ultra-thin gate dielectrics.
In addition to a shift from SiO2 to high-k dielectrics, there has been
a shift from doped polysilicon gates to metal gates with appropriate work
functions. As seen in Eq. (6–38), this can be used to engineer the flat band
voltage, and thus the VT of a MOSFET. This is sometimes referred to as
gate work function engineering. It is interesting that in some ways, things
have come full circle. The first MOSFETs were made with Al gates, which
were supplanted by refractory polysilicon gates which could be patterned
to form masks for the self-aligned source-drain implants and high temperature anneals. We have now gone back to metal gates, using refractory
materials.
In some MOSFET fabrication flows, in order to be able to integrate
the high-k dielectrics which cannot survive the high process temperatures
of source-drain anneals, the source-drains are formed first with a dummy,
sacrificial gate electrode. This gate electrode is then etched off, the high-k
dielectric deposited, and the metal gate formed. Such processes have been
dubbed the gate-last process.
In addition to engineering the gate stack, one must carefully design
the source/drain junctions, the channel doping profile, and the contact metallurgy on the various electrodes to reduce resistance. Those details are discussed in Section 9.3.1.
6.6.2 Enhanced channel Mobility Materials and strained si FETs
The HEMT described in Section 6.3.2 is capable of high-frequency operation and high drive currents because of the high carrier mobilities in the
III–V channel. However, the device tends to suffer from high gate leakage352 Chapter 6
currents and, therefore, low input impedance because of the use of Schottky
gates which tend to be leakier than MOS gates. Unfortunately, high-quality
native thermal oxides such as SiO2 on Si cannot be grown on III–V materials. With the advent of deposited high-k gate dielectrics on Si MOSFETs,
there was a similar move toward depositing high-k gate dielectrics on high
electron mobility compound semiconductors such as InGaAs, to make III–V
NMOSFETs with better performance than Si. Most III–V semiconductors
unfortunately have low hole mobilties; hence, for PMOSFETs, Ge is a better
choice since it has a hole mobility four times that of Si.
A more careful examination of the problem, however, reveals that
the movement to high mobility channels may not always be justified. The
drive current in a MOSFET can be somewhat simplistically considered to
be proportional to the product of carrier density in the channel times the
carrier velocity. The carrier velocity in these high mobility channel materials
is expected to be higher than in Si because it is inversely proportional to the
lower conductivity effective mass [Eq. (3–36)]. Unfortunately, the carrier
density, which depends on the density of states in the channel, is directly proportional to the density-of-states effective mass in a 2-D system such as an
inversion layer [Eq. (IV–10b) in Appendix IV]. Hence, there is a cancellation
of the effective mass terms in the drive current expression. This is known as
the density-of-states bottleneck in these high mobility channels. In addition,
the highest doping densities in the source-drains of such high channel mobility materials are sometimes not as high as in Si, leading to higher sourcedrain access resistance. Finally, we find that many semiconductors with low
effective mass have low band gaps. [Simplistically, this is because low effective masses are associated with high band curvature, which generally implies
wider bands due to larger overlap of wavefunctions, and lower band gaps.]
The low band gaps cause high off-state leakage currents in MOSFETs, which
is particularly problematic for low power logic circuits. Nevertheless, a more
detailed analysis shows that under some circumstances, these high channel
mobility MOSFETs can indeed outperform Si.
Another approach to improving carrier mobilities is to introduce
mechanical strain in the semiconductors. For instance, in Si if uniaxial tensile
strain is introduced in one direction, or biaxial strain in two directions, in
order to break the cubic symmetry of the unit cell, it breaks the six-fold
degeneracy of the conduction band minima in the [100] directions near the
X point (Fig. 3–10a). In bulk Si, for transport in any of the [100] directions,
we get a contribution from two ellipsoidal valleys with high ml, and four valleys with low mt, as described in Example 3–6. Under biaxial tensile strain,
there is a contraction of the planes in the third direction, and the two valleys
in this direction are lowered in energy and are preferentially occupied. For
transport in the plane of tensile strain, both these valleys have the lower
transverse effective mass, mt, leading to an enhancement of the electron
mobility (Fig. 6–49). There is also reduced inter-valley scattering, leading to
a higher scattering mean free time and higher mobility [Eq. (3–40a)]. Similar
enhancements in hole mobility are achievable with compressive strain in Si.­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 353
These effects can be exploited in strained Si channels to enhance
MOSFET drive currents, although there are additional complications due
to carrier confinement in the inversion layers. One way to introduce biaxial
tensile strain in Si is to epitaxially grow it on relaxed, larger lattice constant
SiGe buffer layers grown on a Si substrate [see Fig. 1–14]. Alternatively, uniaxial tensile strain can introduced by judicious deposition of stressor layers
of silicon nitride on the Si MOSFETs. Similarly, process-induced compressive strain is created in Si MOSFETs by etching trenches in the source-drain
regions and re-filling them with larger lattice constant SiGe layers.
6.6.3 sOi MOsFETs and FinFETs
In the previous section, we discussed some of the problems, such as leakage
due to punch-through, in short channel MOSFETs in bulk Si. It is also important to recognize that most of the current flow in the MOSFET is restricted
to a thin layer comparable to the inversion layer thickness (∼10 nm) near the
surface, and most of the bulk Si substrate acts merely as mechanical support
for the MOSFET, and has no electrical function whatsoever. These considerations led to the development of the Silicon-on-Insulator MOSFET (SOI
MOSFET) shown in Fig. 6.50(a) made in a thin (∼10 - 100 nm) Si single
crystal film on an insulating Buried OXide (BOX) layer (∼100 nm thick)
on a bulk Si substrate.
Since SiO2 can easily be grown on Si substrates, it serves as an attractive insulator for subsequent growth of thin-film Si. Since polycrystalline
Si can be deposited directly over SiO2, devices can be made in thin polySi films. However, to avoid grain boundaries and other defects typical of

polycrystalline material, a variety of techniques have been developed to
grow single-crystal Si on oxide. For example, the oxide layer can be formed
beneath the surface of a Si wafer by high-dose oxygen implantation. The
thin Si layer remaining on the surface above the implanted oxide is usually
about 0.1 om thick, and can be used as the thin film for CMOS or other
device fabrication. This process is called separation by implantation of oxygen (SIMOX). In some cases a thicker Si film is grown epitaxially on the
SIMOX wafer, using the thin Si crystalline layer over the oxide as a seed for
the epitaxy. Another approach for making SOI is to place two oxidized Si
wafers face to face, and thermally bond the oxide layers by high temperature
annealing in a furnace. One of the wafers is then chemically etched back
almost completely, leaving a fraction of a micron of single-crystal Si material
on top of the SiO2. This approach is known as Bond-and-Etch-back SOI (BESOI). Since it is challenging to etch off about 600 om of Si and stop controllably so as to leave about a micron of Si, an initial p+ implanted layer is often
used to act as an etch stop near the end of the chemical etch. The chemical

recipe that is used for etching Si has a much lower etch rate in a p+ layer than
in lightly doped Si. Another approach known as Smart Cut is a modification
of BE-SOI using very high dose H implantation into one of the oxidized Si
wafers, such that the peak of the H profile is about a micron below the Si
surface. During the high temperature annealing step, the H atoms coalesce
to form tiny H bubbles which cause a thin layer of Si to cleave off from the
implanted wafer, leaving the Si layer bonded to the oxidized Si surface. This
way, we do not have to chemically etch off one Si wafer for every BE-SOI
wafer. If properly done, the cleaved-off Si wafer has a fairly smooth surface
and can be reused.
Another suitable substrate for such devices is silicon-on-sapphire
(SOS). Epitaxial Si films can be grown on crystalline sapphire (Al2O3) substrates by chemical vapor deposition (e.g., the pyrolysis of silane), with typical film thickness of about 1 om. This is sometimes referred to as SOI-SOS
(a term which can elicit a laugh in an otherwise serious discussion).
The thin SOI film can be patterned by standard photolithographic
techniques into islands for each transistor, making electrical isolation of
adjacent MOSFETs simpler than for bulk Si. Implantation of p+ and n+
areas into these islands for source and drain regions result in the MOS
devices. Since the film is so thin, the source and drain regions can be made
to extend entirely through the film to the insulating substrate. As a result, the
junction capacitance is reduced to the very small capacitance associated with
the sidewalls between the source/drain and the channel region. In addition,
since interconnections between devices pass over the insulating substrate,
the usual interconnection–Si substrate capacitance is reduced (along with the
possibility of parasitic induced channels in the field between devices). These
capacitance reductions improve considerably the high-frequency operation
and power consumption of circuits using such devices.
The electrostatic behavior of the SOI MOSFET in saturation is
improved, because the thinness of the channel layer means the gate exerts
better control of the channel potential than the drain, compared to a bulk
MOSFET. Therefore problems such as DIBL are reduced. Since the leakage
paths in the bulk Si far from gate control are blocked by the BOX layer, the
off-state leakage is lower in SOI MOSFETs, and the channel lengths can
be controlled more aggressively. In fully-depleted extremely thin channel
(∼10 nm) SOI MOSFETs, where the channel depletion layer can extend
throughout the SOI film under typical gate biases, it is possible to leave the
channel undoped and still avoid punch-through, and achieve the required
VT by choosing the gate work function appropriately. Undoped channels
have the advantage of having high carrier mobility due to reduced ionized
impurity scattering, and less VT variations. In a scaled bulk MOSFET, the
total number of dopants in the channel, which is equal to the doping density
times channel volume (= width * length * depletion width), is quite small
and susceptible to statistical dopant number fluctuations, leading to VT variability. An undoped channel SOI MOSFET avoids this problem.
As discussed, the top gate in an SOI MOSFET improves control
of the channel potential compared to bulk devices and leads to better356 Chapter 6
scalability. The electrostatic control can be improved further if multiple
gates can be incorporated to control the channel potential. An elegant way
to achieve this is to etch thin fins of height h and width w in the SOI film,
deposit high-k gate dielectrics on the fins, pattern gates over them, and use
the gate as a self-aligned mask to implant source-drains in the fin, adjacent
to the gate (Fig. 6–50b). Notice that this a non-planar 3-D geometry of the
MOSFET, where the channel is mostly on the two vertical sidewalls of the
fins. The effective width of a so-called FinFET is (2h + w) times the number
of parallel fins. The two self-aligned gates on the sidewalls improve electrostatic control even more than a top-gated SOI MOSFET. Variations of the
FinFET are known as multiple gate FETs (MuGFETs) or tri-gate FETs.
The SOI approach does not suffer from the latchup problem of bulk
CMOS discussed in Chapter 9 because there is no p-n-p-n thyristor from
the power supply to ground. For circuits requiring high speeds, low standby
power due to the elimination of junction leakage to the substrate, and alphaparticle radiation (from cosmic rays and radioactive impurities) tolerance
due to the elimination of the Si substrate, the extra expense of preparing SOI
substrates is compensated by increased performance.
suMMary 6.1 Three-terminal active devices capable of power gain are key to the switching
and amplification of electronic signals. The input impedance is (desirably) high
for voltage-controlled FETs and low for current-controlled bipolar junction
transistors. The power gain of the a-c signal comes from the d-c power supply. It
is also desirable to have a high output impedance and a linear dependence of
output current with respect to input voltage (or current).
6.2 Field effect devices such as the JFETs (or MESFETs and HEMTs) use a
reverse-biased p-n junction (or Schottky diode) as a gate to control the undepleted part of a channel and thereby modulate the current flow between a
source (S) of carriers and a drain (D) of carriers.
6.3 The MOSFET uses an oxide-isolated gate (MOS capacitor) that has a very high
input impedance to modulate the barrier between S and D and to change the
conductivity of the channel.
6.4 An enhancement-mode NMOSFET has a p-type channel between the n+
source and the drain regions. At the flat band conditions (VFB), there is no
band bending as a function of depth in the channel. A gate bias more negative
than VFB causes exponentially more holes to be accumulated near the surface
with band bending.
6.5 More positive gate voltages initially repel the majority carrier holes and create
a depletion region. Then, above the threshold voltage (VT), they attract minority carrier electrons near the surface and invert the surface, thereby forming a
conductive channel between source and drain. PMOSFETs have the opposite
polarities.
6.6 The VT can be increased by increasing the channel doping and the gate oxide
thickness (lower Ci). It is also affected by VFB, which depends on the gate work­Feeld­EEeet raanFnttrn 357
function and oxide charges, and increases with substrate reverse bias (body
effect) as well.
6.7 The overall MOS capacitance is the series combination of a fixed gate capacitance Ci and the voltage-dependent semiconductor capacitance in the channel. The inversion charge per unit area is approximately Ci(VG - VT).
6.8 For long channel MOSFETs, initially ID increases linearly with VD, and then it
saturates once the inversion channel is pinched off near the drain end.
6.9 There is a quadratic dependence of ID on VG for long channel MOSFETs. For
short channel devices that operate in the velocity-saturated region or sourceinjection regime, the dependence of ID on VG is approximately linear.
6.10 For short L, IDsat. often increases slightly with VD due to various short channel effects, leading to a decrease of output impedance. Short channel effects
include drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and charge sharing, which leads
to VT roll-off with L.
6.11 There is some conduction below VT, characterized by a subthreshold slope, that
is a measure of the effectiveness of the MOSFET as a switch.
6.12 Conduction above VT in the channel inversion region reflects an effective channel mobility lower than that in bulk due to surface roughness scattering, and
increasingly so at higher VG.
6.13 In highly scaled MOSFETs, there can be gate-tunneling leakage currents (mitigated by high-k dielectrics) and hot electron (and, to a lesser extent, hole)
effects, mitigated by lower power supply voltages and lightly doped drains
(LDDs). The resulting high­S>D parasitic series resistance is minimized by
Self-Aligned siLICIDEs (SALICIDE), described in Chapter 9.
6.1 Assume the JFET shown in Fig. 6–6 is Si and has p+ regions doped with prObLEMs
1018 acceptors/cm3 and a channel with 1016 donors/cm3. If the channel halfwidth a is 1 om, compare VP with V0. What voltage VGD is required to cause

-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 V.
6.5 Use the field-dependent mobility expression to calculate and plot ID(VD, VG)
for the Si JFET described in Prob. 6.4 for gate lengths of 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0,
and 5.0 om and a gate voltage of 0 V. The field-dependent mobility model of
Eq. (8–12) takes the form358 Chapter 6

regions, and the approximate location of the flat band and threshold voltages. If
the high-frequency capacitance is 250 nF/cm2 in accumulation and 50 nF/cm2 in

6.31 In Prob. 6.5, calculate the depletion charge (QD) and the threshold voltage (VT).
Now suppose a reverse bias of 0.4 V is applied between the substrate and the

6.33 A typical figure of merit for high-frequency operation of MOS transistors is
the cutoff frequency fc = gm/2pCGLZ, where the gate capacitance CG is essentially Ci over most of the voltage range. Express fc above pinch-off in terms of
materials parameters and device dimensions, and calculate fc for the transistor
of Prob. 6.32, with L = 1 om.

that the source and drain regions of an n-channel Si MOSFET are doped with
1020 donors/cm3 and the 1­mm­long channel is doped with 1016 acceptors/cm3.
If the source and substrate are grounded, what drain voltage will cause
punch-through?

Bipolar Junction Transistors
We begin this chapter with a qualitative discussion of charge transport in a
bipolar junction transistor (BJT), to establish a sound physical understanding of its operation. Then we shall investigate carefully the charge distributions in the transistor and relate the three terminal currents to the physical
characteristics of the device. Our aim is to gain a solid understanding of the
current flow and control of the transistor and to discover the most important
secondary effects that influence its operation. We shall discuss the properties
of the transistor with proper biasing for amplification and then consider the
effects of more general biasing, as encountered in switching circuits.
In this chapter we shall use the p-n-p transistor for most illustrations.
The main advantage of the p-n-p for discussing transistor action is that hole
flow and current are in the same direction. This makes the various mechanisms of charge transport somewhat easier to visualize in a preliminary
explanation. Once these basic ideas are established for the p-n-p device, it is
simple to relate them to the more widely used transistor, the n-p-n.

The bipolar transistor is basically a simple device, and this section is devoted
to a simple and largely qualitative view of BJT operation. We will deal with
the details of these transistors in the following sections, but first we must
define some terms and gain physical understanding of how carriers are transported through the device. Then we can discuss how the current through two
terminals can be controlled by small changes in the current at a third terminal.

Let us begin the discussion of bipolar transistors by considering the
reverse-biased p-n junction diode of Fig. 7–1. According to the theory of
Chapter 5, the reverse saturation current through this diode depends on
the rate at which minority carriers are generated in the neighborhood of
the junction. We found, for example, that the reverse current due to holes
being swept from n to p is essentially independent of the size of the junction
e field and hence is independent of the reverse bias. The reason given was
that the hole current depends on how often minority holes are generated by
EHP creation within a diffusion length of the junction—not upon how fast a
particular hole is swept across the depletion layer by the field. As a result, it
is possible to increase the reverse current through the diode by increasing the
rate of EHP generation (Fig. 7–1b). One convenient method for accomplishing this is optical excitation of EHPs with light (hn 7 Eg), as in Section 4.3.
With steady photoexcitation the reverse current will still be essentially independent of bias voltage, and if the dark saturation current is negligible, the
reverse current is directly proportional to the optical generation rate gop.
The example of external control of current through a junction by optical generation raises an interesting question: Is it possible to inject minority
carriers into the neighborhood of the junction electrically instead of optically? If so, we could control the junction reverse current simply by varying
the rate of minority carrier injection. For example, let us consider a hypothetical hole injection device as in Fig. 7–1c. If we can inject holes at a predetermined rate into the n side of the junction, the effect on the junction
current will resemble the effects of optical generation. The current from n to
p will depend on the hole injection rate and will be essentially independent
of the bias voltage. There are several obvious advantages to such an external
control of a current; for example, the current through the reverse-biased
junction would vary very little if the load resistor RL were changed, since the
magnitude of the junction voltage is relatively unimportant. Therefore, such
an arrangement should be a good approximation to a controllable constant
current source.
A convenient hole injection device is a forward-biased p+-n junction.
According to Section 5.3.2, the current in such a junction is due primarily to
holes injected from the p+ region into the n material. If we make the n side

of the forward-biased junction the same as the n side of the reverse-biased
junction, the p+-n-p structure of Fig. 7–2 results. With this configuration,
injection of holes from the p+-n junction into the center n region supplies
the minority carrier holes to participate in the reverse current through the
n-p junction. Of course, it is important that the injected holes do not recombine in the n region before they can diffuse to the depletion layer of the
reverse-biased junction. Thus we must make the n region narrow compared
with a hole diffusion length.
The structure we have described is a p-n-p BJT. The forward-biased
junction that injects holes into the center n region is called the emitter junction, and the reverse-biased junction that collects the injected holes is called
the collector junction. The p+ region, which serves as the source of injected
holes, is called the emitter, and the p region into which the holes are swept
by the reverse-biased junction is called the collector. The center n region
is called the base, for reasons which will become clear in Section 7.3, when
we discuss the historical development of transistor fabrication. The biasing
arrangement in Fig. 7–2 is called the common base configuration, since the
base electrode B is common to the emitter and collector circuits.
To have a good p-n-p transistor, we would prefer that almost all the
holes injected by the emitter into the base be collected. Thus the n-type base
region should be narrow, and the hole lifetime tp should be long. This requirement is summed up by specifying Wb ⪡ Lp, where Wb is the length of the
neutral n material of the base (measured between the depletion regions of
the emitter and collector junctions) and Lp is the diffusion length for holes in
the base (Dptp)1>2. With this requirement satisfied, an average hole injected
at the emitter junction will diffuse to the depletion region of the collector
junction without recombination in the base. A second requirement is that the
current IE crossing the emitter junction should be composed almost entirely
of holes injected into the base, rather than electrons crossing from base to
emitter. This requirement is satisfied by doping the base region lightly compared with the emitter, so that the p+-n emitter junction of Fig. 7–2 results.

It is clear that current IE flows into the emitter of a properly biased
p-n-p transistor and that IC flows out at the collector, since the direction
of hole flow is from the emitter to collector. However, the base current IB
requires a bit more thought. In a good transistor the base current will be
very small since IE is essentially hole current, and the collected hole current
IC is almost equal to IE. There must be some base current, however, due to
requirements of electron flow into the n-type base region (Fig. 7–3). We can
account for IB physically by three dominant mechanisms:
(a) There must be some recombination of injected holes with electrons
in the base, even with Wb ⪡ Lp. The electrons lost to recombination
must be resupplied through the base contact.
(b) Some electrons will be injected from n to p in the forward-biased
emitter junction, even if the emitter is heavily doped compared with
the base. These electrons must also be supplied by IB.
(c) Some electrons are swept into the base at the reverse-biased collector junction due to thermal generation in the collector. This small
current reduces IB by supplying electrons to the base.
The dominant sources of the base current are (a) recombination in the
base and (b) injection into the emitter region. Both of these effects can be
greatly reduced by device design, as we shall see. In a well-designed transistor, IB will be a very small fraction (perhaps one-hundredth) of IE.
In an n-p-n transistor the three current directions are reversed, since
electrons flow from the emitter to collector and holes must be supplied to the
base. The physical mechanisms for operation of the n-p-n can be understood
simply by reversing the roles of electrons and holes in the p-n-p discussion.

In this section we shall discuss rather simply the various factors involved
in transistor amplification. Basically, the transistor is useful in amplifiers
because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by the relatively small base current. The essential mechanisms are easy to understand if
various secondary effects are neglected. We shall use total current (d-c plus
a-c) in this discussion, with the understanding that the simple analysis applies
only to d-c and to small-signal a-c at low frequencies. We can relate the
terminal currents of the transistor iE, iB, and iC by several important factors.
In this introduction we shall neglect the saturation current at the collector
(Fig. 7–3, component 3) and such effects as recombination in the transition
regions. Under these assumptions, the collector current is made up entirely of
those holes injected at the emitter, which are not lost to recombination in the
base. Thus iC is proportional to the hole component of the emitter current iEp:
iC = BiEp (7–1)
The proportionality factor B is simply the fraction of injected holes which
make it across the base to the collector; B is called the base transport factor.
The total emitter current iE is made up of the hole component iEp and the
electron component iEn, due to electrons injected from the base to emitter
(component 5 in Fig. 7–3). The emitter injection efficiency g is
g =
i
Ep
iEn + iEp
(7–2)
For an efficient transistor we would like B and g to be very near unity;
that is, the emitter current should be due mostly to holes (g ≃ 1), and most
of the injected holes should eventually participate in the collector current
(B ≃ 1). The relation between the collector and emitter currents is
iC
iE
=
Bi
Ep
iEn + iEp
= Bg K a (7–3)
The product Bg is defined as the factor a, called the current transfer ratio,
which represents the emitter-to-collector current amplification. There is
no real amplification between these currents, since a is smaller than unity.
On the other hand, the relation between iC and iB is more promising for
amplification.
In accounting for the base current, we must include the rates at which
electrons are lost from the base by injection across the emitter junction (iEn)
and the rate of electron recombination with holes in the base. In each case,
the lost electrons must be resupplied through the base current iB. If the fraction of injected holes making it across the base without recombination is B,
it follows that (1-B) is the fraction recombining in the base. Thus the base
current is
iB = iEn + (1-B)iEp (7–4)

The factor b relating the collector current to the base current is the base-tocollector current amplification factor.1 Since a is near unity, it is clear that b
can be large for a good transistor, and the collector current is large compared
with the base current.
It remains to be shown that the collector current iC can be controlled
by variations in the small current iB. In the discussion to this point, we have
indicated control of iC by the emitter current iE, with the base current characterized as a small side effect. In fact, we can show from space charge neutrality arguments that iB can indeed be used to determine the magnitude of iC.
Let us consider the transistor of Fig. 7–4, in which iB is determined by a biasing circuit. For simplicity, we shall assume unity emitter injection efficiency
and negligible collector saturation current. Since the n-type base region is
electrostatically neutral between the two transition regions, the presence of

excess holes in transit from emitter to collector calls for compensating excess
electrons from the base contact. However, there is an important difference
in the times that electrons and holes spend in the base. The average excess
hole spends a time tt, defined as the transit time from the emitter to collector. Since the base width Wb is made small compared with Lp, this transit
time is much less than the average hole lifetime tp in the base.2 On the other
hand, an average excess electron supplied from the base contact spends tp
seconds in the base supplying space charge neutrality during the lifetime
of an average excess hole. While the average electron waits tp seconds for
recombination, many individual holes can enter and leave the base region,
each with an average transit time tt. In particular, for each electron entering
from the base contact, tp>tt holes can pass from the emitter to collector while
maintaining space charge neutrality. Thus the ratio of collector current to
base current is simply
iC
iB
= b =
tp tt
(7–7)
for g = 1 and negligible collector saturation current.
If the electron supply to the base (iB) is restricted, the traffic of holes
from the emitter to base is correspondingly reduced. This can be argued simply by supposing that the hole injection does continue despite the restriction
on electrons from the base contact. The result would be a net buildup of positive charge in the base and a loss of forward bias (and therefore a loss of hole
injection) at the emitter junction. Clearly, the supply of electrons through iB
can be used to raise or lower the hole flow from emitter to collector.
The base current is controlled independently in Fig. 7–4. This is called
a common-emitter circuit, since the emitter electrode is common to the base
and collector circuits. The emitter junction is clearly forward biased by the
battery in the base circuit. The voltage drop in the forward-biased emitter
junction is small, however, so that almost all of the voltage from the collector
to emitter appears across the reverse-biased collector junction. Since vBE is
small for the forward-biased junction, we can neglect it and approximate the
base current as 5 V/50 kΩ = 0.1 mA. If t
p = 10 os and tt = 0.1 os, b for the
transistor is 100 and the collector current IC is 10 mA. It is important to note
that i
c is determined by b and the base current, rather than by the battery
and resistor in the collector circuit (as long as these are of reasonable values
to maintain a reverse-biased collector junction). In this example 5 V of the
2This difference between average hole lifetime before recombination (tp) and the average time a hole
spends in transit across the base (tt) may be confusing at first. How can the lifetime be longer than the
time a hole actually spends in transit? The answer depends on the fact that holes are indistinguishable in
the recombination kinetics. Think of an analogy with a shooting gallery, in which a good marksman fires
slowly at a line of quickly moving ducks. Although many individual ducks make it across the firing line
without being hit, the lifetime of an average duck within the firing line is determined by the time between
shots. We can speak of the lifetime of an average duck because they are essentially indistinguishable.
Similarly, the rate of recombination in the base (and therefore iB) depends on the average lifetime tp and
the distribution of the indistinguishable holes in the base region.Bipolar Junction Transistors 375
The first transistor invented by Bardeen and Brattain in 1947 was the point
contact transistor. In this device two sharp metal wires, or “cat’s whiskers,”
formed an “emitter” of carriers and a “collector” of carriers. These wires were
simply pressed onto a slab of Ge which provided a “base” or mechanical support, through which the injected carriers flowed. This basic invention rapidly
led to the BJT, in which charge injection and collection was achieved using
two p-n junctions in proximity to each other. The p-n junctions in BJTs can
be formed in a variety of ways using thermal diffusion, but modern devices
are generally made using ion implantation (Section 5.1.4).
Let us review a simplified version of how to make a double polysilicon, self-aligned n-p-n Si BJT. This is the most commonly used, state-of-theart technique for making BJTs for use in an IC. Use of n-p-n transistors is
more popular than p-n-p devices because of the higher mobility of electrons
collector circuit battery voltage appears across the 500 Ω resistor, and 5 V
serves to reverse bias the collector junction.
If a small a-c current ib is superimposed on the steady state base current
of Fig. 7–4a, a corresponding a-c current ic appears in the collector circuit.
The time-varying portion of the collector current will be ib multiplied by the
factor b, and current gain results.
We have neglected a number of important properties of the transistor
in this introductory discussion, and many of these properties will be treated
in detail below. We have established, however, the fundamental basis of operation for the bipolar transistor and have indicated in a simplified way how it
can be used to produce current gain in an electronic circuit.

compared with holes. The process steps are shown in cross-sectional view in
Fig. 7–5. A p-type Si substrate is oxidized, windows are defined using photolithography and etched in the oxide. Using the photoresist and oxide as
an implant mask, a donor with very small diffusivity in Si, such as As or Sb,
is implanted into the open window to form a highly conductive n+ layer
(Fig. 7–5a). Subsequently, the photoresist and the oxide are removed, and a
lightly doped n-type epitaxial layer is grown. During this high temperature
growth, the implanted n+ layer diffuses only slightly toward the surface and
becomes a conductive buried collector (also called a sub-collector). The n+
sub-collector layer guarantees a low collector series resistance when it is
connected subsequently to the collector ohmic contact, sometimes through
the use of an optional, masked deep n+ “sinker” implant or diffusion only in
the collector contact region (Fig. 7–5c). The lightly doped n-type collector

emitter are formed ensures a high base-collector reverse breakdown voltage.
(It turns out that wherever the sub-collector is formed, and subsequently the
epitaxial layer is grown on top, there is a notch or step in the substrate surface. This notch is not explicitly shown in Fig. 7–5a. This notch is very useful
as a marker of the location of the sub-collectors because, subsequently, we
have to align the LOCOS isolation mask with respect to the sub-collector.)
For integrated circuits involving not just discrete BJTs, but many interconnected transistors, there are issues involving electrical isolation of adjacent
BJTs in order to ensure that there is no electrical cross-talk between them.
As described in Section 6.4.1, such an isolation can be achieved by LOCOS
to form field or isolation oxides after a B channel stops implant (Fig. 7–5b).
Another isolation scheme that is particularly well suited for high-density
bipolar circuits involves the formation of shallow trenches by reactive ion
etching (RIE), backfilled with oxide and polysilicon (Section 9.3.1). In this
process a nitride layer is patterned and used as an etch mask for an anisotropic etch of the silicon to form the trench. Using RIE, a narrow trench about
1 mm deep can be formed with very straight sidewalls. Oxidation inside the
trench forms an insulating layer, and the trench is then filled with oxide by
low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD).
A polysilicon layer is deposited by LPCVD, and doped heavily p +
with B either during deposition or subsequently by ion implantation. An
oxide layer is deposited next by LPCVD. Using photolithography with the
base/emitter mask, a window is etched in the polysilicon/oxide stack by RIE
(Fig. 7–5c). A heavily doped “extrinsic” p + base is formed by diffusion of
B from the doped polysilicon layer into the substrate in order to provide a
low-resistance, high-speed base ohmic contact. An oxide layer is then deposited by LPCVD, which has the effect of closing up the base window that
was etched previously, and B is implanted into this window (Fig. 7–5d). This
base implant forms a more lightly p doped “intrinsic” base through which
most of the current flows from the emitter to the collector. The more heavily doped extrinsic base forms a collar around the intrinsic base, and serves
to reduce the base series resistance. It is critical that the base be enclosedBipolar Junction Transistors 377

well within the collector because otherwise it would be shorted to the psubstrate. Finally, another LPCVD oxide layer is deposited to close up the
base window further, and the oxide is etched all the way to the Si substrate
by RIE, leaving oxide spacers on the sidewalls. Heavily n + doped (typically
with As) polysilicon is then deposited on the substrate, patterned and etched,
forming polysilicon emitter (polyemitter) and collector contacts, as shown
in Fig. 7–5e. (The use of two LPCVD polysilicon layers explains why this
process is referred to as the double-polysilicon process.) Arsenic from the
polysilicon is diffused into the substrate to form the n + emitter region nested
within the base in a self-aligned manner, as well as the n + collector contact. Self-alignment refers to the fact that a separate lithography step is not
required to form the n + emitter region. We cleverly made use of the oxide
sidewall spacers to ensure that the n + emitter region lies within the intrinsic
p-type base. This is critical because otherwise the emitter gets shorted to the
collector; we also want a gap between the n + emitter and the p + extrinsic
base, because otherwise the emitter–base junction capacitance becomes too
high. In the vertical direction, the difference between the emitter–base junction and the base–collector junction determines the base width. This is made
very narrow in high gain, high speed BJTs.
Finally, an oxide layer is deposited by CVD, windows are etched in it
corresponding to the emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C) contacts, and
a suitable contact metal such as Al is sputter deposited to form the ohmic
contacts. The Al is patterned photolithographically using the interconnect
mask, and etched using RIE. The many ICs that are made simultaneously
on the wafer are then separated into individual dies by sawing, mounted on
suitable packages, and the various contacts are wire bonded to the external
leads of the package.
In this section we examine the operation of a BJT in more detail. We begin
our analysis by applying the techniques of previous chapters to the problem
of hole injection into a narrow n-type base region. The mathematics is very
similar to that used in the problem of the narrow base diode (Prob. 5.40).
Basically, we assume holes are injected into the base at the forward-biased
emitter, and these holes diffuse to the collector junction. The first step is to
solve for the excess hole distribution in the base, and the second step is to
evaluate the emitter and collector currents (IE, IC) from the gradient of the
hole distribution on each side of the base. Then the base current (IB) can
be found from a current summation or from a charge control analysis of
recombination in the base.
We shall at first simplify the calculations by making several assumptions:
1. Holes diffuse from the emitter to collector; drift is negligible in the
base region.
2. The emitter current is made up entirely of holes; the emitter injection
efficiency is g = 1 .

3. The collector saturation current is negligible.
4. The active part of the base and the two junctions are of uniform
cross-sectional area A; current flow in the base is essentially onedimensional from the emitter to collector.
5. All currents and voltages are steady state.
In later sections we shall consider the implications of imperfect injection efficiency, drift due to nonuniform doping in the base, structural effects
such as different areas for the emitter and collector junctions, and capacitance and transit time effects in a-c operation.
7.4.1 solution of the diffusion equation in the Base region
Since the injected holes are assumed to flow from the emitter to collector by
diffusion, we can evaluate the currents crossing the two junctions by techniques
used in Chapter 5. Neglecting recombination in the two depletion regions, the
hole current entering the base at the emitter junction is the current IE, and
the hole current leaving the base at the collector is IC. If we can solve for the
distribution of excess holes in the base region, it is simple to evaluate the gradient of the distribution at the two ends of the base to find the currents. We
shall consider the simplified geometry of Fig. 7–6a, in which the base width is
Wb between the two depletion regions, and the uniform cross-sectional area
is A. In equilibrium, the Fermi level is flat, and the band diagram corresponds
to that for two back-to-back p-n junctions. But, for a forward-biased emitter
and a reverse-biased collector (normal active mode), the Fermi level splits up
into quasi-Fermi levels, as shown in Fig. 7–6b. The barrier at the emitter–base
junction is reduced by the forward bias, and that at the collector–base junction
is increased by the reverse bias. The excess hole concentration at the edge of
the emitter depletion region ∆pE and the corresponding concentration on the
collector side of the base ∆pC are found from Eq. (5–29):
∆pE = pn(eqVEB>kT - 1) (7–8a)
∆pC = pn(eqVCB>kT - 1) (7–8b)
If the emitter junction is strongly forward biased (VEB ⪢ kT > q) and the
collector junction is strongly reverse biased (VCB V 0), these excess concentrations simplify to
∆pE ≃ pneqVEB>kT (7–9a)
∆pC ≃ - pn (7–9b)
We can solve for the excess hole concentration as a function of distance
in the base dp(xn) using the proper boundary conditions in the diffusion
equation, Eq. (4–34b):

The solution of this equation is
dp(xn) = C1exn>Lp + C2e-xn>Lp (7–11)
where L
p is the diffusion length of holes in the base region. Unlike the
simple problem of injection into a long n region, we cannot eliminate one
of the constants by assuming the excess holes disappear for large xn. In fact,Bipolar Junction Transistors 381
since Wb ⪡ Lp in a properly designed transistor, most of the injected holes
reach the collector at Wb. The solution is very similar to that of the narrow
base diode problem. In this case the appropriate boundary conditions are
dp(xn = 0) = C1 + C2 = ∆pE (7–12a)
dp(xn = Wb) = C1eWb>Lp + C2e-Wb>Lp = ∆pC (7–12b)
Solving for the parameters C1 and C2 we obtain
C1 =
∆pC - ∆pEe-Wb>Lp
eWb>Lp - e-Wb>Lp (7–13a)
C2 =
∆pEeWb>Lp - ∆pC
eWb>Lp - e-Wb>Lp (7–13b)
These parameters applied to Eq. (7–11) give the full expression for the excess
hole distribution in the base region. For example, if we assume that the collector junction is strongly reverse biased [Eq. (7–9b)] and the equilibrium
hole concentration pn is negligible compared with the injected concentration
∆pE, the excess hole distribution simplifies to
dp(xn) = ∆pE eWb>Lpe-xn>Lp - e-Wb>Lpexn>Lp
eWb>Lp - e-Wb>Lp (for ∆pC ≃ 0) (7–14)
The various terms in Eq. (7–14) are sketched in Fig. 7–7a, and the corresponding excess hole distribution in the base region is demonstrated for a
moderate value of Wb>Lp. Note that dp(xn) varies almost linearly between
the emitter and collector junction depletion regions. As we shall see, the
slight deviation from linearity of the distribution indicates the small value
of IB caused by recombination in the base region.
The minority carrier electron concentrations in the emitter and collector corresponding to a forward-biased emitter and reverse-biased collector
are shown in Fig. 7–7b. Here, the excess electron concentration in the p+ emitter is shown to decay exponentially to zero, corresponding to a long diode.
This is because, at high emitter doping levels, the minority carrier electron
diffusion length is often shorter than the thin emitter region. Otherwise, the
narrow diode expressions must be used in the emitter region. For polyemitter
structures, the carrier concentration profile is more complicated, as discussed
later. The exact form of iEn and the emitter injection efficiency will therefore
depend on these details.
7.4.2 evaluation of the Terminal currents
Having solved for the excess hole distribution in the base region, we can
evaluate the emitter and collector currents from the gradient of the hole
concentration at each depletion region edge. From Eq. (4–22b) we have

By using the techniques of Chapter 5 we have evaluated the three terminal currents of the transistor in terms of the material parameters, the base
width, and the excess concentrations ∆pE and ∆pC. Furthermore, since these
excess concentrations are related in a straightforward way to the emitter and
collector junction bias voltages by Eq. (7–8), it should be simple to evaluate
the transistor performance under various biasing conditions. It is important
to note here that Eqs. (7–18) and (7–19) are not restricted to the case of
the usual transistor biasing. For example, ∆pc may be -pn for a strongly
reverse-biased collector, or it may be a significant positive number if the collector is positively biased. The generality of these equations will be used in
Section 7.5 in considering the application of transistors to switching circuits.

7.4.3 approximations of the Terminal currents
The general equations of the previous section can be simplified for the case
of normal transistor biasing, and such a simplification allows us to gain
insight into the current flow. For example, if the collector is reverse biased,
∆pC = -pn from Eq. (7–9b). Furthermore, if the equilibrium hole concentration pn is small (Fig. 7–8a), we can neglect the terms involving ∆pC.

For small values of Wb>Lp, we can neglect the terms above the first order of

This expression for IB accounts for recombination in the base region.
We must include injection into the emitter in many BJT devices, as discussed
in Section 7.4.4.
If recombination in the base dominates the base current, IB can be
obtained from the charge control model, assuming an essentially straight-line
hole distribution in the base (Fig. 7–8b). Since the hole distribution diagram
appears as a triangle in this approximation, we have

(7–24)
which is the same as that found in Eqs. (7–21) and (7–22).
Since we have neglected the collector saturation current and have
assumed g = 1 in these approximations, the difference between IE and IC is
accounted for by the requirements of recombination in the base. In Eq. (7–24)
we have a clear demonstration that the base current is reduced for small
Wb and large tp. We can increase tp by using light doping in the base region,
which of course also improves the emitter injection efficiency.
The straight-line approximation of the excess hole distribution (Fig. 7–8)
is fairly accurate in calculating the base current. On the other hand, it does
not give a valid picture of IE and IC. If the distribution were perfectly straight,
the slope would be the same at each end of the base region. This would imply
zero base current, which is not the case. There must be some “droop” to the
distribution, as in the more accurate curve of Fig. 7–7. This slight deviation
from linearity gives a steeper slope at xn = 0 than at xn = Wb, and the value
of IE is larger than IC by the amount IB. The reason we can use the straightline approximation in the charge control calculation of base current is that the
area under the hole distribution curve is essentially the same in the two cases.
7.4.4 current Transfer ratio
The value of IE calculated thus far in this section is more properly designated
I
Ep, since we have assumed that g = 1 (the emitter current due entirely to
hole injection). Actually, there is always some electron injection across the
forward-biased emitter junction in a real transistor, and this effect is important in calculating the current transfer ratio. As shown in Example 7–3, the
emitter injection efficiency of a p-n-p transistor can be written in terms of
the emitter and base properties:
g = c 1 + LLn pp npnpnmmnn pp tanh WLn pb d -1 ≃ c 1 + WLp nbnpnpmmn pnp d -1 (7–25)
In this equation we use superscripts to indicate which side of the emitter–
base junction is referred to. For example, Ln p is the hole diffusion length in
the n-type base region and mnp is the electron mobility in the p-type emitter
region. In an n-p-n the superscripts and subscripts would be changed along
with the majority carrier symbols. Using Eq. (7–20a) for IEp, and Eq. (7–20b)
for IC, the base transport factor B is
B =

I
Ep

(7–26)
and the current transfer ratio a is the product of B and g as in Eq. (7–3).Bipolar Junction Transistors 387
The expressions derived in Section 7.4 describe the terminal currents of the
transistor, if the device geometry and other factors are consistent with the
assumptions. Real transistors may deviate from these approximations, as we
shall see in Section 7.7. The collector and emitter junctions may differ in area,
saturation current, and other parameters, so that the proper description of
the terminal currents may be more complicated than Eqs. (7–18) and (7–19)
suggest. For example, if the roles of the emitter and collector are reversed,
these equations predict that the behavior of the transistor is symmetrical.
Real transistors, on the other hand, are generally not symmetrical between
emitter and collector. This is a particularly important consideration when the
transistor is not biased in the usual way. We have discussed normal biasing
(sometimes called the normal active mode), in which the emitter junction
is forward biased and the collector is reverse biased. In some applications,
particularly in switching, this normal biasing rule is violated. In these cases it
is important to account for the differences in injection and collection properties of the two junctions. In this section we shall develop a generalized

approach which accounts for transistor operation in terms of a coupled-diode
model, valid for all combinations of emitter and collector bias. This model
involves four measurable parameters that can be related to the geometry
and material properties of the device. Using this model in conjunction with
the charge control approach, we can describe the physical operation of a
transistor in switching circuits and in other applications.
7.5.1 The coupled-diode model
If the collector junction of a transistor is forward biased, we cannot neglect
∆pC; instead, we must use a more general hole distribution in the base region.
Fig. 7–9a illustrates a situation in which the emitter and collector junctions
are both forward biased, so that ∆pE and ∆pC are positive numbers. We can
handle this situation with Eqs. (7–18) and (7–19) for the symmetrical transistor. It is interesting to note that these equations can be considered as linear
superpositions of the effects of injection by each junction. For example, the
straight line hole distribution of Fig. 7–9a can be broken into the two components of Figs. 7–9b and c. One component (Fig. 7–9b) accounts for the holes
injected by the emitter and collected by the collector. We can call the resulting currents (IEN and ICN) the normal mode components, since they are due
to injection from emitter to collector. The component of the hole distribution
illustrated by Fig. 7–9c results in currents IEI and ICI, which describe injection in the inverted mode of injection from collector to emitter.3 Of course,
these inverted components will be negative, since they account for hole flow
opposite to our original definitions of IE and IC.
For the symmetrical transistor, these various components are

The four components are combined by linear superposition in Eq. (7–18):
IE
= IEN + IEI = a∆pE - b∆pC (7–28a)
= A(eqVEB>kT - 1) - B(eqVCB>kT - 1)
IC = ICN + ICI = b∆pE - a∆pC (7–28b)
= B(eqVEB>kT - 1) - A(eqVCB>kT - 1)
where A K apn and B K bpn.
We can see from these equations that a linear superposition of the normal and inverted components does give the result we derived previously for
the symmetrical transistor. To be more general, however, we must relate the
four components of current by factors which allow for asymmetry in the two
junctions. For example, the emitter current in the normal mode can be written
IEN = IES(eqVEB>kT - 1), ∆pC = 0 (7–29)
where IES is the magnitude of the emitter saturation current in the normal
mode. Since we specify ∆pC = 0 in this mode, we imply that VCB = 0 in
Eq. (7–8b). Thus we shall consider IES to be the magnitude of the emitter
saturation current with the collector junction short circuited. Similarly, the
collector current in the inverted mode is
ICI = -ICS(eqVCB>kT - 1), ∆pE = 0 (7–30)
where ICS is the magnitude of the collector saturation current with VEB = 0.
As before, the minus sign associated with ICI simply means that in the
inverted mode holes are injected opposite to the defined direction of IC.
The corresponding collected currents for each mode of operation can
be written by defining a new a for each case:
ICN = aNIEN = aNIES(eqVEB>kT - 1) (7–31a)
IEI = aIICI = -aIICS(eqVCB>kT - 1) (7–31b)
where aN and aI are the ratios of collected current to injected current in each
mode. We notice that in the inverted mode the injected current is ICI and the
collected current is IEI.
The total current can again be obtained by superposition of the
components:
IE
= IEN + IEI = IES(eqVEB>kT - 1) - aIICS(eqVCB>kT - 1) (7–32a)
IC = ICN + ICI = aNIES(eqVEB>kT - 1) - ICS(eqVCB>kT - 1) (7–32b)
These relations were derived by J. J. Ebers and J. L. Moll and are
referred to as the Ebers–Moll equations.4 While the general form is the same
4J. J. Ebers and J. L. Moll, “Large-Signal Behavior of Junction Transistors,” Proceedings of the IRE, 42,
pp. 1761–72 (December 1954). In the original paper and in many texts, the terminal currents are all
defined as flowing into the transistor. This introduces minus signs into the expressions for IC and IB as
we have developed them here.390 Chapter 7
as Eqs. (7–28) for the symmetrical transistor, these equations allow for variations in IES, ICS, aI, and aN due to asymmetry between the junctions. Although
we shall not prove it here, it is possible to show by reciprocity arguments that
aNIES = aIICS (7–33)
even for nonsymmetrical transistors.
An interesting feature of the Ebers–Moll equations is that IE and IC
are described by terms resembling diode relations (IEN and ICI), plus terms
that provide coupling between the properties of the emitter and collector
(IEI and ICN). This coupled-diode property is illustrated by the equivalent
circuit of Fig. 7–10. In this figure we take advantage of Eq. (7–8) to write the
Ebers–Moll equations in the form

It is often useful to relate the terminal currents to each other as well as to
the saturation currents. We can eliminate the saturation current from the coupling term in each part of Eqs. (7–32). For example, by multiplying Eq. (7–32a)
by aN and subtracting the resulting expression from Eq. (7–32b), we have
IC = aNIE - (1 - aNaI)ICS(eqVCB>kT - 1) (7–35)
Similarly, the emitter current can be written in terms of the collector current:
IE
= aIIC + (1 - aNaI)IES(eqVEB>kT - 1) (7–36)
The terms (1 - aNaI)ICS and (1 - aNaI)IES can be abbreviated as ICO and IEO,
respectively, where ICO is the magnitude of the collector saturation current
with the emitter junction open (IE = 0) and IEO is the magnitude of the

describe both the emitter and collector currents in terms of a simple diode
characteristic plus a current generator proportional to the other current. For
example, under normal biasing the equivalent circuit reduces to the form
shown in Fig. 7–11b. The collector current is aN times the emitter current plus
the collector saturation current, as expected. The resulting collector characteristics of the transistor appear as a series of reverse-biased diode curves,
displaced by increments proportional to the emitter current (Fig. 7–11c).

7.5.2 charge control analysis
The charge control approach is useful in analyzing the transistor terminal currents, particularly in a-c applications. Considerations of transit time effects and
charge storage are revealed easily by this method. Following the techniques
of the previous section, we can separate an arbitrary excess hole distribution
in the base into the normal and inverted distributions of Fig. 7–9. The charge
stored in the normal distribution will be called QN and the charge under the
inverted distribution will be called QI. Then we can evaluate the currents for
the normal and inverted modes in terms of these stored charges. For example,
the collected current in the normal mode ICN is simply the charge QN divided
by the mean time required for this charge to be collected. This time is the
transit time for the normal mode ttN. On the other hand, the emitter current
must support not only the rate of charge collection by the collector but also
the recombination rate in the base QN>tpN. Here we use a subscript N with the
transit time and lifetime in the normal mode in contrast to the inverted mode,
to allow for possible asymmetries due to imbalance in the transistor structure.
With these definitions, the normal components of current become
ICN =
QN
ttN
, IEN =
QN
ttN
+
QN

(7–38a)
Similarly, the inverted components are
IEI = -

ttI
, ICI = -
QI
ttI

QI
tpI
(7–38b)
where the I subscripts on the stored charge and on the transit and recombination times designate the inverted mode. Combining these equations as in
Eqs. (7–32) we have the terminal currents for general biasing:

IC =
QN

It is not difficult to show that these equations correspond to the Ebers–Moll
relations [Eq. (7–34)], where
aN =
tpN
ttN + tpN
, aI =
tpI
ttI + tpI

QN = qN

The base current in the normal mode supports recombination, and the
base-to-collector current amplification factor bN takes the form predicted
by Eq. (7–7):
IBN =
QN
tpN
, bN =
ICN
IBN
=
tpN
ttN
(7–41)
This expression for bN is also obtained from aN>(1 - aN). Similarly, IBI is
QI>tpI, and the total base current is
IB
= IBN + IBI =
QN
tpN
+
QI
tpI
(7–42)
This expression for the base current is substantiated by IE - IC from
Eq. (7–39).
The effects of time dependence of stored charge can be included in
these equations by the methods introduced in Section 5.5.1. We can include
the proper dependencies by adding a rate of change of stored charge to each
of the injection currents IEN and ICI:
iE = QN at1tN + t1pN b - QttII + dQ dtN (7–43a)

We shall return to these equations in Section 7.8, when we discuss the use of
transistors at high frequencies.Bipolar Junction Transistors 395
In a switching operation a transistor is usually controlled in two conduction
states, which can be referred to loosely as the “on” state and the “off” state.
Ideally, a switch should appear as a short circuit when turned on and an open
circuit when turned off. Furthermore, it is desirable to switch the device from
one state to the other with no lost time in between. Transistors do not fit this
ideal description of a switch, but they can serve as a useful approximation
in practical electronic circuits. The two states of a transistor in switching can
be seen in the simple common-emitter example of Fig. 7–12. In this figure
the collector current iC is controlled by the base current iB over most of the
family of characteristic curves. The load line specifies the locus of allowable
(iC, -vCE) points for the circuit, in analogy with Fig. 6–2. If iB is such that the
operating point lies somewhere between the two end points of the load line

(Fig. 7–12b), the transistor operates in the normal active mode. That is, the
emitter junction is forward biased and the collector is reverse biased, with
a reasonable value of iB flowing out of the base. On the other hand, if the
base current is zero or negative, the point C is reached at the bottom end
of the load line, and the collector current is negligible. This is the “off” state
of the transistor, and the device is said to be operating in the cutoff regime.
If the base current is positive and sufficiently large, the device is driven to
the saturation regime, marked S. This is the “on” state of the transistor, in
which a large value of iC flows with only a very small voltage drop vCE. As
we shall see below, the beginning of the saturation regime corresponds to
the loss of reverse bias across the collector junction. In a typical switching
operation the base current swings from positive to negative, thereby driving
the device from saturation to cutoff, and vice versa. In this section we shall
explore the nature of conduction in the cutoff and saturation regimes; also
we shall investigate the factors affecting the speed with which the transistor
can be switched between the two states.
The various regions of operation of a BJT are illustrated in Fig. 7–12c.
If the emitter junction is forward biased and the collector reverse biased,
we have the normal active mode; the opposite gives us the inverted mode
of operation. If both junctions are reverse biased, we get cutoff, leading to a
very high impedance state of the BJT; if both junctions are forward biased,
we have saturation and a low impedance state.
7.6.1 cutoff
If the emitter junction is reverse biased in the cutoff regime (negative iB), we
can approximate the excess hole concentrations at the edges of the reversebiased emitter and collector junctions as
∆pE
pn
≃
∆pC
pn
≃ -1 (7–44)
which implies p(xn) = 0. The excess hole distribution in the base is approximately constant at -pn, with some slope to the distribution at each edge to
account for the reverse saturation current in the junctions. The base current
iB can be approximated for a symmetrical transistor on a charge storage basis
as -qApnWb>tp. In this calculation, a negative excess hole concentration corresponds to generation in the same way that a positive distribution indicates
recombination. This expression is also obtained by applying Eq. (7–44) to
Eq. (7–19) with an approximation from Table 7–1. Physically, a small saturation current flows from n to p in each reverse-biased junction, and this
current is supplied by the base current iB (which is negative when flowing
into the base of a p-n-p device according to our definitions). A more general
evaluation of the currents can be obtained from the Ebers–Moll equations
by applying Eq. (7–44) to Eq. (7–34):Bipolar Junction Transistors 397
iE = -IES + aIICS = -(1 - aN)IES (7–45a)
iC = -aNIES + ICS = (1 - aI)ICS (7–45b)
iB = iE - iC = -(1 - aN)IES - (1 - aI)ICS (7–45c)
If the short-circuit saturation currents IES and ICS are small and aN and aI are
both near unity, these currents will be negligible and the cutoff regime will
closely approximate the “off” condition of an ideal switch. The equivalent
circuit corresponding to Eq. (7–45) is illustrated in Fig. 7–13b.
7.6.2 saturation
The saturation regime begins when the reverse bias across the collector junction is reduced to zero, and it continues as the collector becomes forward
biased. The excess hole distribution in this case is illustrated in Fig. 7–14.

(b) oversaturation.398 Chapter 7
The device is saturated when ∆pC = 0, and forward bias of the collector
junction (Fig. 7–14b) leads to a positive ∆pC, driving the device further into
saturation. With the load line fixed by the battery and the 5@kΩ resistor in
Fig. 7–12, saturation is reached by increasing the base current iB. We can
see how a large value of iB leads to saturation by applying the reasoning
of charge control to Fig. 7–14. Since a certain amount of stored charge is
required to accommodate a given iB (and vice versa), an increase in iB calls
for an increase in the area under the ∆p(xn) distribution.
In Fig. 7–14a the device has just reached saturation, and the collector
junction is no longer reverse biased. The implication of this condition for
the circuit of Fig. 7–12 is easy to state. Since the emitter junction is forward biased and the collector junction has zero bias, very little voltage
drop appears across the device from the collector to emitter. The magnitude of -vCE is only a fraction of a volt. Therefore, almost all of the battery
voltage appears across the resistor, and the collector current is approximately 40 V>5 kΩ = 8 mA. As the device is driven deeper into saturation
(Fig. 7–14b), the collector current stays essentially constant while the base
current increases. In this saturation condition the transistor approximates
the “on” state of an ideal switch.
Although the degree of “oversaturation” (indicated by the shaded area
in Fig. 7–14b) does not affect the value of iC significantly, it is important in
determining the time required to switch the device from one state to the
other. For example, from previous experience we expect the turn-off time
(from saturation to cutoff) to be longer for larger values of stored charge
in the base. We can calculate the various charging and delay times from
Eq. (7–43). Detailed calculations are somewhat involved, but we can simplify
the problem greatly with approximations of the type used in Chapter 5 for
transient effects in p-n junctions.
7.6.3 The switching cycle
The various mechanisms of a switching cycle are illustrated in Fig. 7–15. If
the device is originally in the cutoff condition, a step increase of base current
to IB causes the hole distribution to increase approximately as illustrated in
Fig. 7–15b. As in the transient analysis of Chapter 5, we assume for simplicity of calculation that the distribution maintains a simple form in each time
interval of the transient. At time t
s the device enters saturation, and the hole
distribution reaches its final state at t2. As the stored charge in the base Qb
increases, there is an increase in the collector current iC. The collector current
does not increase beyond its value at the beginning of saturation ts, however.
We can approximate this saturated collector current as IC ≃ ECC>RL, where
ECC is the value of the collector circuit battery and RL is the load resistor
(IC ≃ 8 mA for the example of Fig. 7–12). There is an essentially exponential
increase in the collector current while Qb rises to its value Qs at ts; this rise
time serves as one of the limitations of the transistor in a switching application. Similarly, when the base current is switched negative (e.g., to theBipolar Junction Transistors 399
value -IB), the stored charge must be withdrawn from the base before cutoff
is reached. While Qb is larger than Qs, the collector current remains at the
value IC, fixed by the battery and resistor. Thus there is a storage delay time
tsd after the base current is switched and before iC begins to fall toward zero.
After the stored charge is reduced below Qs, iC drops exponentially with the
characteristic fall time. Once the stored charge is withdrawn, the base current
cannot be maintained any longer at its large negative value and must decay
to the small cutoff value described by Eq. (7–45c).
7.6.4 specifications for switching Transistors
We can determine t
s and tsd by solving for the time-dependent base current,
iB(t), given by an expression similar to Eq. (5–47). We must also not neglect
the charging time of the emitter junction capacitance in going from cutoff
to saturation. Since the emitter junction is reverse biased in cutoff, it is necessary for the emitter space charge layer to be charged to the forward-bias
condition before collector current can flow. Therefore, we should include a

The approach we have taken in analyzing the properties of transistors has
involved a number of simplifying assumptions. Some of the assumptions
must be modified in dealing with practical devices. In this section we investigate some common deviations from the basic theory and indicate situations
in which each effect is important. Since the various effects discussed here
involve modifications of the more straightforward theory, they are often
labeled “secondary effects.” This does not imply that they are unimportant; in fact, the effects described in this section can dominate the conduction in transistors under certain conditions of device geometry and circuit
application.
In this section we shall consider the effects of nonuniform doping in
the base region of the transistor. In particular, we shall find that graded doping can lead to a drift component of charge transport across the base, adding
to the diffusion of carriers from emitter to collector. We shall discuss the
effects of large reverse bias on the collector junction, in terms of widening
the space charge region about the junction and avalanche multiplication.
We shall see that transistor parameters are affected at high current levels
by the degree of injection and by heating effects. We shall consider several
structural effects that are important in practical devices, such as asymmetry
in the areas of the emitter and collector junctions, series resistance between
the base contact and the active part of the base region, and nonuniformity of injection at the emitter junction. All these effects are important in
understanding the operation of transistors, and proper consideration of their
interactions can contribute greatly to the usefulness of practical transistor
circuits.

7.7.1 drift in the Base region
The assumption of uniform doping in the base breaks down for implanted
junction transistors that usually involve an appreciable amount of impurity
grading; for example, the implanted transistor of Fig. 7–5 has a doping profile
similar to that sketched in Fig. 7–17. In this example there is a fairly sharp
discontinuity in the doping profile, when the donor concentration in the base
region becomes smaller than the constant p-type background doping in the
collector. Similarly, the emitter is assumed to be a heavily doped (p+) shallow
region, providing a second rather sharp boundary for the base. Within the
base region itself, however, the net doping concentration (Nd - Na K N)
varies along a profile that decreases from the emitter edge to the collector
edge. The most likely doping distribution in the base is a portion of a gaussian (see Section 5.1.4); however, we can clearly see the effect of an impurity
gradient by assuming for simplicity that N(xn) varies exponentially within
the base region (Fig. 7–17b).
One important result of a graded base region is that a built-in electric
field exists from emitter to collector (for a p-n-p), thereby adding a drift
component to the transport of holes across the base. We can demonstrate this
effect very simply by considering the required balance of drift and diffusion
in the base at equilibrium. If the net donor doping of the base is large enough
to allow the usual approximation n(xn) ≃ N(xn), the balance of electron
drift and diffusion currents at equilibrium requires

For the example of an exponential doping profile, the electric field
ℰ(xn) turns out to be constant with position in the base. We can represent an
exponential distribution as
N(xn) = N(0)e-axn>Wb where a K ln N(0)

Taking the derivative of this distribution and substituting in Eq. (7–47), we

(7–49)
Since this field aids the transport of holes across the base region from
emitter to collector, the transit time tt is reduced below that of a comparable
uniform base transistor. Similarly, electron transport in an n-p-n is aided by
the built-in field in the base. This shortening of the transit time can be very
important in high-frequency devices (Section 7.8.2). Another approach for
obtaining a built-in field is to vary the alloy composition x (and therefore Eg)
in a base made of an alloy such as Si1 - xGex or InxGa1-xAs. We will discuss
this further in Section 7.9.
7.7.2 Base narrowing
In the discussion of transistors thus far, we have assumed that the effective base width Wb is essentially independent of the bias voltages applied
to the collector and emitter junctions. This assumption is not always valid;
for example, the p+@n@p+ transistor of Fig. 7–18 is affected by the reverse
bias applied to the collector. If the base region is lightly doped, the depletion region at the reverse-biased collector junction can extend significantly
into the n-type base region. As the collector voltage is increased, the space
charge layer takes up more of the metallurgical width of the base Lb, and as a
result, the effective base width Wb is decreased. This effect is variously called
base narrowing, base-width modulation, and the Early effect after J. M. Early,
who first interpreted it. The effects of base narrowing are apparent in the
collector characteristics for the common-emitter configuration (Fig. 7–18b).
The decrease in Wb causes b to increase. As a result, the collector current
IC increases with collector voltage rather than staying constant as predicted
from the simple treatment. The slope introduced by the Early effect is almost
linear with IC, and the common-emitter characteristics extrapolate to an
intersection with the voltage axis at VA, called the Early voltage.
For the p+@n@p+ device of Fig. 7–18 we can approximate the length l of
the collector junction depletion region in the n material from Eq. (5–23b)
with V0 replaced by V0 - VCB and VCB taken to be large and negative:
l = a2qN PVBC d b 1>2 (7–50)Bipolar Junction Transistors 403
If the reverse bias on the collector junction is increased far enough, it
is possible to decrease Wb to the extent that the collector depletion region
essentially fills the entire base. In this punch-through condition holes are
swept directly from the emitter region to the collector, and transistor action is
lost. Punch-through is a breakdown effect that is generally avoided in circuit
design. In most cases, however, avalanche breakdown of the collector junction occurs before punch-through is reached. We shall discuss the effects of
avalanche multiplication in the following section.
In devices with graded base doping, base narrowing is of less importance. For example, if the donor concentration in the base region of a p-n-p
increases with position from the collector to the emitter, the intrusion of
the collector space charge region into the base becomes less important with
increased bias as more donors are available to accommodate the space charge.
7.7.3 avalanche Breakdown
Before punch-through occurs in most transistors, avalanche multiplication
at the collector junction becomes important (see Section 5.4.2). As Fig. 7–19
indicates, the collector current increases sharply at a well-defined breakdown
voltage BVCBO for the common-base configuration. For the common-emitter
case, however, there is a strong influence of carrier multiplication over a
fairly broad range of collector voltage. Furthermore, the breakdown voltage in the common-emitter case BVCEO is significantly smaller than BVCBO.
We can understand these effects by considering breakdown for the condition IE = 0 in the common-base case and for IB = 0 in the common-emitter

showing the increase in IC with increased collector voltage. The black lines in (b) indicate the
extrapolation of the curves to the Early voltage VA.404 Chapter 7
case. These conditions are implied by the O in the subscripts of BVCEO and
BVCBO. In each case the terminal current IC is the current entering the collector depletion region multiplied by the factor M. Including multiplication
due to impact ionization, Eq. (7–37b) becomes
IC = (aNIE + ICO)M = (aNIE + ICO) 1
1 - (VBC>BVCBO)n (7–51)
where for M we have used the empirical expression given in Eq. (5–44).
For the limiting common-base case of IE = 0 (the lowest curve in
Fig. 7–19a), IC is simply MICO, and the breakdown voltage is well defined,
as in an isolated junction. The term BVCBO signifies the collector junction
breakdown voltage in common-base with the emitter open. In the commonemitter case the situation is somewhat more complicated. Setting IB = 0, and
therefore, IC = IE in Eq. (7–51), we have
IC =
MICO
1 - MaN (7–52)
We notice that in this case the collector current increases indefinitely
when MaN approaches unity. By contrast, M must approach infinity in the
common-base case before BVCBO is reached. Since aN is close to unity in
most transistors, M need be only slightly larger than unity for Eq. (7–52)
to approach breakdown. Avalanche multiplication thus dominates the current in a common-emitter transistor well below the breakdown voltage of
the isolated collector junction. The sustaining voltage for avalanching in the
common-emitter case BVCEO is therefore smaller than BVCBO.
We can understand physically why multiplication is so important in
the common-emitter case by considering the effect of M on the base current. When an ionizing collision occurs in the collector junction depletion
region, a secondary hole and electron are created. The primary and secondary holes are swept into the collector in a p-n-p, but the electron is swept
into the base by the junction field. Therefore, the supply of electrons to the
base is increased, and from our charge control analysis we conclude that hole

injection at the emitter must increase to maintain space charge neutrality.
This is a regenerative process, in which an increased injection of holes from
the emitter causes an increased multiplication current at the collector junction; this in turn increases the rate at which secondary electrons are swept
into the base, calling for more hole injection. Because of this regenerative
effect, it is easy to understand why the multiplication factor M need be only
slightly greater than unity to start the avalanching process.
7.7.4 injection level; Thermal effects
In discussions of transistor characteristics we have assumed that a and b are
independent of carrier injection level. Actually, the parameters of a practical
transistor may vary considerably with injection level, which is determined by
the magnitude of IE or IC. For very low injection, the assumption of negligible
recombination in the junction depletion regions is invalid (see Section 5.6.2).
This is particularly important in the case of recombination in the emitter
junction, where any recombination tends to degrade the emitter injection
efficiency g. Thus we expect that a and b should decrease for low values of IC,
causing the curves of the collector characteristics to be spaced more closely
for low currents than for higher currents.
As IC is increased beyond the low injection level range, a and b
increase but fall off again at very high injection. The primary cause of this
fall-off is the increase of majority carriers at high injection levels (see Section 5.6.1). For example, as the concentration of excess holes injected into the
base becomes large, the matching excess electron concentration can become
greater than the background nn. This base conductivity modulation effect
results in a decrease in g as more electrons are injected across the emitter
junction into the emitter region.
Large values of IC may be accompanied by significant power dissipation in the transistor and therefore heating of the device. In particular, the
product of IC and the collector voltage VBC is a measure of the power dissipated at the collector junction. This dissipation is due to the fact that carriers
swept through the collector junction depletion region are given increased
kinetic energy, which in turn is given up to the lattice in scattering collisions. It is very important that the transistor be operated in a range such that
ICVBC does not exceed the maximum power rating of the device. In devices
designed for high power capability, the transistor is mounted on an efficient
heat sink, so that thermal energy can be transferred away from the junction.
If the temperature of the device is allowed to increase due to power
dissipation or thermal environment, the transistor parameters change. The
most important parameters dependent on temperature are the carrier lifetimes and diffusion coefficients. In Si or Ge devices the lifetime t
p increases
with temperature for most cases, due to thermal reexcitation from recombination centers. This increase in t
p tends to increase b for the transistor. On
the other hand, the mobility decreases with increasing temperature in the
lattice-scattering range, varying approximately as T - 3>2 (see Fig. 3–22). Thus406 Chapter 7
from the Einstein relation, we expect Dp to decrease as the temperature
increases, thereby causing a drop in b due to an increasing transit time tt. Of
these competing processes, the effect of increasing lifetime with temperature
usually dominates, and b becomes larger as the device is heated. It is clear
from this effect that thermal runaway can occur if the circuit is not designed
to prevent it. For example, a large power dissipation in the device can cause
an increase in T; this results in a large b and therefore a large IC for a given
base current; the large IC causes more collector dissipation and the cycle continues. This type of runaway of the collector current can result in overheating
and destruction of the device.
7.7.5 Base resistance and emitter crowding
A number of structural effects are important in determining the operation of
a transistor. For example, the emitter and collector areas are considerably different in the implanted transistor of Fig. 7–20a. This and most other structural
effects can be accounted for by differences in aN, aI, and other parameters
in the Ebers–Moll model. Several effects caused by the structural arrangement of real transistors deserve special attention, however. One of the most
important of these effects is the fact that base current must pass from the
active part of the base region to the base contacts B. Thus, to be accurate,

we should include a resistance rb in equivalent models for the transistor to
account for voltage drops that may occur between B and the active part of
the base. Because of rb, it is common to contact the base with the metallization pattern on both sides of the emitter, as in Fig. 7–20c.
If the transistor is designed so that the n-type regions leading from
the base to the contacts are large in cross-sectional area, the base resistance
rb may be negligible. On the other hand, the distributed resistance r′b along
the thin base region is almost always important.5 Since the width of the base
between the emitter and collector is very narrow, this distributed resistance
is usually quite high. Therefore, as base current flows from points within the
base region toward each end, a voltage drop occurs along r′b. In this case the
forward bias across the emitter–base junction is not uniform, but instead
varies with position according to the voltage drop in the distributed base
resistance. In particular, the forward bias of the emitter junction is largest at
the corner of the emitter region near the base contact. We can see that this
is the case by considering the simplified example of Fig. 7–20e. Neglecting
variations in the base current along the path from point A to the contact
B, the forward bias of the emitter junction above point A is approximately
VEA = VEB - IB(RAD + RDB) (7–53)
Actually, the base current is not uniform along the active part of the base
region, and the distributed resistance of the base is more complicated than
we have indicated. But this example does illustrate the point of nonuniform injection. Whereas the forward bias at A is approximately described by
Eq. (7–53), the emitter bias voltage at point D is
VED = VEB - IBRDB (7–54)
which can be significantly closer to the applied voltage VEB.
Since the forward bias is largest at the edge of the emitter, it follows
that the injection of holes is also greatest there. This effect is called emitter
crowding, and it can strongly affect the behavior of the device. The most
important result of emitter crowding is that high-injection effects described
in the previous section can become dominant locally at the corners of the
emitter before the overall emitter current is very large. In transistors designed
to handle appreciable current, this is a problem which must be dealt with
by proper structural design. The most effective approach to the problem of
emitter crowding is to distribute the emitter current along a relatively large
emitter edge, thereby reducing the current density at any one point. Clearly,
what is needed is an emitter region with a large perimeter compared with its
area. A likely geometry to accomplish this is a long thin stripe for the emitter,
with base contacts on each side (Fig. 7–20b and c). With this geometry the
total emitter current IE is spread out along a rather long edge on each side
of the stripe. An even better geometry is several emitter stripes, connected
5The distributed resistance r′b is often called the base spreading resistance.408 Chapter 7
electrically by the metallization and separated by interspersing base contacts
(Fig. 7–21). Many such thin emitter and base contact “fingers” can be interlaced to provide for handling large current in a power transistor. This is often
called very descriptively an interdigitated geometry.
7.7.6 Gummel–poon model
The Ebers–Moll model runs into problems if a high degree of accuracy is
required for very small BJTs, or where second-order effects become important. The Gummel–Poon model, which is a charge control model, incorporates much more physics. We present a simplified version of the model here.
As discussed in Section 7.7.1, for typical graded doping profiles in the
base, there is a built-in electric field that causes drift of minority carriers
in the same direction they are diffusing from the emitter to collector. This
forms the starting point for the derivation of the Gummel–Poon model. As
mentioned in Section 7.7.1, this electric field aids the motion of the minority
carriers in the base, so the current can be written as
I
Ep = qAopp(xn)e - qADp
dp(xn)

(7–55)
We can replace the electric field in the base in Eq. (7–55) by the expression

We integrate both sides of Eq. (7–57b) from the emitter–base junction (0) to
the base–collector junction (Wb), keeping in mind that the current IEp, flowing from the emitter to the collector, is more or less constant in the narrow
base (so that it can be pulled out of the integral).

We have assumed a constant hole diffusivity in the base, Dp. The integral in
the denominator corresponds to the integrated majority carrier charge in the
base, and is known as the base Gummel number, QB. In the normal active
mode of operation, where the collector–base junction is reverse biased (VCB
is negative), and the emitter–base junction is forward biased, the emitter hole
current flowing to the collector (which is the dominant current) becomes
I
Ep =
qADpn2 i eqV kTEB
QB (7–62a)410 Chapter 7
We can similarly write the base electron current flowing back into the emitter as
IEn =
qADnn2 i eqV kTEB
QE (7–62b)
where QE is the integrated majority carrier charge in the emitter, known as
the emitter Gummel number. The crux of the Gummel–Poon model is that
the currents are expressed in terms of the net integrated charges in the base
and emitter regions, and can easily handle nonuniform doping. Also, since
we have obtained expressions for IEp and IEn in terms of QB and QE, we can
write down BJT parameters such as the emitter injection efficiency g [see
Eq. (7–2)], in terms of the Gummel numbers.
We can also modify the Gummel–Poon model to handle several
second-order effects such as the Early effect and high-level injection in the
base, simply by writing the expression for the base Gummel number, QB,
more precisely as follows:
QB = L0(WVbEB (V) CB)n(xn)dxn (7–63)
where we explicitly account for the fact that the integration limits, the base–
emitter junction (xn = 0) and the base–collector junction (Wb) are bias
dependent. This is, of course, the Early effect (Section 7.7.2).
Furthermore, we see that under high-level injection (Sections 5.6.1 and
7.7.4), the integrated majority carrier charge becomes greater than the integrated base dopant charge:
L0 Wbn(xn)dxn 7 L0 WbND(xn)dxn (7–64)
Clearly, from Eq. (7–61), this will cause the current from the emitter-to-collector, IEp, to increase less rapidly with emitter-base voltage at high biases.
Based on what we learned in Section 5.6.1 about high-level injection in a
diode, the emitter-to-collector current for high-level injection in the base
increases as
IC ∝ IEp ∝ e
qVEB
2kT (7–65a)
On the other hand, because the emitter doping is typically higher than the
base doping, one does not see high-level injection effects in the emitter, and
the base current injected into the emitter scales as
IB
∝ IEn ∝ e

This result shows that the common-emitter gain decreases at high injection levels due to excess majority carriers in the base.
The Gummel–Poon model also accounts for generation–recombination effects in the base-emitter depletion region at low current levels. As
discussed in Section 5.6.2, such effects are accounted for by the diode ideality
factor, n. Hence the base current injected into the emitter can be written as
IB
∝ IEn ∝ e
qVEB
nkT (7–66a)
On the other hand, the generally large emitter current injected into the
base is not likely to be affected by the generation–recombination effects.
Therefore,

The transistor collector current IC and the base current IB are plotted
on a semilog scale as a function of VEB in Fig. 7–22a. This is referred to as a
Gummel plot. The current gain b is shown as a function of IC in Fig. 7–22b.
We see the dependence of b on IC in the different bias regions, as described
by the Gummel–Poon model. At low injection levels b is degraded by poor
emitter injection efficiency [Eq. (7–67)], and at high currents b decreases due
to excess majority charge in the base, which degrades g. It can be shown that
if one neglects the Early effect (i.e., we assume an infinite Early voltage) and
the drop of b at high current levels, the Gummel–Poon model simplifies to
the Ebers–Moll model.
7.7.7 Kirk effect
The current gain drops at high collector currents due to yet another mechanism known as the Kirk effect. This involves an effective widening of the
neutral base due to modification of the depletion space charge distribution
at the reverse-biased base-collector junction. This is caused by the buildup412 Chapter 7
of mobile carriers due to increased current flow from the emitter to the collector. This is illustrated in Fig. 7–23 for a p-n-p BJT. Notice that the polarity
of these mobile charges adds to the fixed donor charges on the base side of
the base-collector depletion region, but subtracts from the fixed acceptor
charges on the collector side of the junction (Fig. 7–23c). Therefore, fewer
uncompensated donors (and thus a smaller depletion width) are needed to
maintain the reverse voltage VCB across this junction. As a result, the neutral
base width increases from Wb in Fig. 7–23b to W′b in Fig. 7–23c. Also, the
depletion region extends more into the collector side. This is tantamount to
moving the base-collector junction deeper into the collector. This leads to an
effective widening of the neutral base region (the Kirk effect) and to a drop
of the current gain and an increase of the base transit time.

Assuming that VCB is fixed, and IC increases, the last term in Eq. (7–68)
becomes more important with respect to the ionized dopant charges. In
Poisson’s equation [Eq. (7–68)], the extra holes injected into the depletion
region have the same effect as if the doping level on the base side were
increased and that on the collector side decreased. Since the integral of this
field with respect to distance is fixed at VCB [Eq. (7–69)], this implies that the
depletion region on the base side collapses.
Although we have chosen to illustrate the Kirk effect for a p-n-p BJT,
similar results are obtained for the n-p-n transistor. Obviously, the treatment is identical except for the polarity of the various charges. From a more
detailed analysis, for n-p-n devices with an n+ sub-collector, it can be shown
that the base widening can extend at even higher current levels all the way
through the lightly doped collector region to the heavily doped buried
sub-collector.
6Since elements such as rb and rc in Fig. 7–24 are added to the basic transistor model we have previously
analyzed, it is most convenient to refer here to the terminal voltages and currents as v′be, i′c, and so
on. In this way we can use previously derived expressions involving the internal quantities [ib and veb in
Eq. (7–74), for example]. In most circuits texts the primes are instead used for the internal quantities, just
the opposite method from that used here.

limiTaTiOns OF
TransisTOrs
In this section we discuss the properties of bipolar transistors under highfrequency operation. Some of the frequency limitations are junction capacitance, charging times required when excess carrier distributions are altered,
and transit time of carriers across the base region. Our aim here is not to
attempt a complete analysis of high-frequency operation, but rather to consider the physical basis of the most important effects. Therefore, we shall
include the dominant capacitances and charging times and discuss the effects
of the transit time on high-frequency devices.
7.8.1 capacitance and charging Times
The most obvious frequency limitation of transistors is the presence of junction capacitance at the emitter and collector junctions. We have considered
this type of capacitance in Chapter 5, and we can include junction capacitors
C
je and Cjc in circuit models for the transistor (Fig. 7–24a). If there is some
equivalent resistance rb between the base contact and the active part of the
base region, we can also include it in the model, along with rc to account for
a series collector resistance.6 Clearly, the combinations of rb with Cje and rc
with C
jc can introduce important time constants into a-c circuit applications
of the device.
From Section 5.5.4 we recall that capacitive effects can arise from the
requirements of altering the carrier distributions during time-varying injection. In a-c circuits the transistor is usually biased to a certain steady state
operating point characterized by the d-c quantities VBE, VCE, IC, IB, and IE,Bipolar Junction Transistors 415
and then a-c signals are superimposed upon these steady state values. We
shall call the a-c terms vbe, vce, ic, ib, and ie. Total (a@c + d@c) quantities will
be lowercase with capitalized subscripts.
If a small a-c signal is applied to the emitter p-n junction along with a
d-c level, we can show that
∆pE(t) ≃ ∆pE(d@c) a1 + qkT veb b (7–70)
We can relate this time-varying excess hole concentration to the stored
charge in the base region, and then use Eq. (7–43) to determine the resulting currents. For simplicity we shall assume the device is biased in the normal
active mode and use only QN(t). Assuming an essentially triangular excess
hole distribution in the base, Eq. (7–23) gives
QN(t) = 1 2qAWb∆pE(t) = 1 2qAWb∆pE(d@c)c 1 + qkT veb d (7–71)
The terms outside the brackets constitute the d-c stored charge IBtp:
Qn(t) = IBtpa1 + qkT veb b (7–72)

Now that we have a simple relation for the time-dependent stored
charge, we can use Eq. (7–43c) to write the total base current as

As discussed in Section 5.5.4, we must be careful about boundary conditions in determining where the stored charges are extracted or “reclaimed”
in a diode. For the emitter-base diode in a BJT, we have a “short” diode
where Eq. (5–64) is applicable. The result is that only two-thirds of the stored
charge is reclaimed. Hence, we obtain

Thus, as in the case of the simple diode, an a-c conductance and capacitance

(7–75)
The quantity gm is an a-c transconductance, which is evaluated at
the steady state value of collector current IC = bIB. We can synthesize
Eqs. (7–74) and (7–75) in an equivalent a-c circuit as in Fig. 7–24b. In this
equivalent circuit the voltage vbe used in the calculations appears “inside”
the device, so that a new applied voltage v′be must be used external to rb to
refer to the voltage applied between the contacts, and similarly for v′ce. This
equivalent model is discussed in detail in most electronic circuits texts; it is
often called a hybrid-pi model.
From Fig. 7–24b it is clear that several charging times are important in
the a-c operation of a transistor; the most important are the time required
to charge the emitter and collector depletion regions and the delay time
in altering the charge distribution in the base region. Other delay times
included in a complete analysis of high-frequency transistors are the transitBipolar Junction Transistors 417
time through the collector depletion region and the charge storage time in
the collector region. If all of these are included in a single delay time td, we
can estimate the upper frequency limit of the device. This is usually defined
as the cutoff frequency for the transistor fT K (2ptd)-1. It is possible to show
that fT represents the frequency at which the a-c amplification for the device
[b(a@c) K hfe = 0i′c>0i′b] drops to unity.
7.8.2 Transit Time effects
In high-frequency transistors the ultimate limitation is often the transit time
across the base. For example, in a p-n-p device the time tt required for holes
to diffuse from emitter to collector can determine the maximum frequency
of operation for the device. We can calculate tt for a transistor with normal
biasing and g = 1 from Eq. (7–20) and the relation b ≃ tp/tt:
b ≃

tanh Wb >2Lp =
2L2
p
Wb 2 =
2D
ptp
W2 b =
tp tt
tt
=
W2 b
2D
p
(7–76)
Another instructive way of calculating tt is to consider that the diffusing holes seem to have an average velocity 8v(xn)9 (actually the individual
hole motion is completely random, as discussed in Section 4.4.1). The hole
current i
p(xn) is then given by
i
p(xn) = q Ap(xn)8v(xn)9 (7–77)
The transit time is
tt
= L0 Wb 8vdx (xnn)9 = L0 WbqAp ip(x(nx)n)dxn (7–78)
For a triangular distribution as in Fig. 7–8b, the diffusion current is almost
constant at i
p = qADp∆pE>Wb, and tt becomes
tt
=
qA ∆pEWb>2
qADp∆pE>Wb =
W2 b
2D
p
(7–79)
as before. The average velocity concept should not be pushed too far in the
case of diffusion, but it does serve to illustrate the point that a delay time
exists between the injection and collection of holes.
We can estimate the transit time for a typical device by choosing a value of Wb, say 0.1 mm (10 - 5cm). For Si, a typical number for Dp is
about 10 cm2/s; then for this transistor tt = 0.5 * 10 - 11 s. Approximating
the upper frequency limit as (2ptt)-1, we can use the transistor to about
30 GHz. Actually, this estimate is too optimistic because of other delay times.418 Chapter 7
The transit time can be reduced by making use of field-driven currents in the
base. For the implanted transistor of Fig. 7–17, the holes drift in the built-in
field from emitter to collector over most of the base region. By increasing
the doping gradient in the base, we can reduce the transit time and thereby
increase the maximum frequency of the transistor.
7.8.3 webster effect
While the transit time expression [Eq. (7–79)] is valid for low-level injection,
tt
is reduced by up to a factor of 2 under high-level injection. This occurs
because the majority carrier concentration increases significantly above its
equilibrium value in the base, to match the injected minority carrier concentration. Since the minority carrier concentration decreases from the baseemitter junction to the base-collector junction (see Fig. 7–8), so does the
majority carrier concentration. This tends to create a diffusion of the majority carriers from emitter to base. Such a majority carrier diffusion would
upset the drift–diffusion balance required to maintain a quasi-equilibrium
distribution in the base. Therefore, a built-in electric field develops in the
base to create an opposing majority carrier drift current. The direction of
this induced field then aids the minority carrier transport from the emitter
to the collector, reducing the transit time tt in Eq. (7–79).
This is known as the Webster effect. It is interesting to note that this
effect is similar to the drift field effects in the base region due to nonuniform
base doping (Section 7.7.1). For the Webster effect, the induced field is not
due to nonuniform doping but rather the nonuniform majority carrier concentration induced by carrier injection.
7.8.4 high-Frequency Transistors
The most obvious generality we can make about the fabrication of highfrequency transistors is that the physical size of the device must be kept
small. The base width must be narrow to reduce the transit time, and the
emitter and collector areas must be small to reduce junction capacitance.
Unfortunately, the requirement of small size generally works against the
requirements of power rating for the device. Since we usually require a tradeoff between frequency and power, the dimensions and other design features
of the transistor must be tailored to the specific circuit requirements. On
the other hand, many of the fabrication techniques useful for power devices
can be adapted to increase the frequency range. For example, the method of
interdigitation (Fig. 7–21) provides a means of increasing the useful emitter
edge length while keeping the overall emitter area to a minimum. Therefore,
some form of interdigitation is generally used in transistors designed for high
frequency and reasonable power requirements.
Another set of parameters that must be considered in the design of a
high-frequency device is the effective resistance associated with each region
of the transistor. Since the emitter, base, and collector resistances affect
the various RC charging times, it is important to keep them to a minimum.Bipolar Junction Transistors 419
Therefore, the metallization patterns contacting the emitter and base regions
must not present significant series resistance. Furthermore, the semiconductor regions themselves must be designed to reduce resistance. For example,
the series base resistance rb of an n-p-n device can be reduced greatly by
performing a p+ diffusion between the contact area on the surface and the
active part of the base region. Further reduction of base resistance by heavy
doping of the base requires the use of a heterojunction (Section 7.9) to maintain g at an acceptable value.
In Si, n-p-n transistors are usually preferred, since the electron mobility
and diffusion coefficient are higher than for holes. It is common to fabricate
n-p-n transistors in n-type epitaxial material grown on an n+ substrate. The
heavily doped substrate provides a low-resistance contact to the collector
region, while maintaining low doping in the epitaxial collector material to
ensure a high breakdown voltage of the collector junction (see Section 7.3). It
is important, however, to keep the collector depletion region as small as possible to reduce the transit time of carriers drifting through the collector junction. This can be accomplished by making the lightly doped collector region
narrow so that the depletion region under bias extends to the n+ substrate.
As described in Section 7.3, an n+ polysilicon layer is generally deposited on the top of the single-crystal n+ emitter. The reason for this can be
understood from Fig. 7–25. If an ohmic contact were formed directly on
top of the narrow n+ emitter, the excess minority carrier hole concentration profile would have a steep gradient because the excess minority carrier
concentrations are zero at the ohmic contacts. This leads to a large backinjected base current IEp into the emitter and a degraded emitter injection
efficiency. The use of a polysilicon emitter causes the hole concentration
profile to have a gentler slope near the base-emitter junction, thereby leading
to an improved g. The steeper slope of the hole concentration profile in the
polysilicon emitter simply reflects the fact that the grain boundary defects
in polysilicon lead to a shorter diffusion length.

dashed line.420 Chapter 7
In addition to the various parameters of the device itself, the transistor must be packaged properly to avoid parasitic resistance, inductance, or
capacitance at high frequencies. We shall not attempt to describe the many
techniques for mounting and packaging transistors here, since methods vary
greatly among manufacturers.
In Section 7.4.4 we saw that the emitter injection efficiency of a bipolar transistor is limited by the fact that carriers can flow from the base into the
emitter region, over the emitter junction barrier, which is reduced by the
forward bias. According to Eq. (7–25) it is necessary to use lightly doped
material for the base region and heavily doped material for the emitter
to maintain a high value of g and, therefore, a and b. Unfortunately, the
requirement of light base doping results in undesirably high base resistance.
This resistance is particularly noticeable in transistors with very narrow base
regions. Furthermore, degenerate doping can led to a slight shrinkage of Eg
in the emitter as the donor states merge with the conduction band. This can
decrease the emitter injection efficiency. Therefore, a more suitable BJT for
high frequency would have a heavily doped base and a lightly doped emitter. This is just the opposite of the traditional BJT discussed thus far in this
chapter. To accomplish such a radically different transistor design, we need
some other mechanism instead of doping to control the relative amount of
injection of electrons and holes across the emitter junction.
If transistors are made in materials that allow heterojunctions to be
used, the emitter injection efficiency can be increased without strict requirements on doping. In Fig. (7–26) an n-p-n transistor made in a single material
(homojunction) is contrasted with a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT),
in which the emitter is a wider band gap semiconductor. It is possible in such
a structure for the barrier for electron injection (qVn) to be smaller than
the hole barrier (qVp). Since carrier injection varies exponentially with the
barrier height, even a small difference in these two barriers can make a very
large difference in the transport of electrons and holes across the emitter
junction. Neglecting differences in carrier mobilities and other effects, we
can approximate the dependence of carrier injection across the emitter as
In Ip
∝
NE d
NB
a
e∆Eg>kT (7–80)
In this expression, the ratio of electron current In to hole current Ip crossing
the emitter junction is proportional to the ratio of the doping in the emitter
NE d and the base NB a . In the homojunction BJT this doping ratio is all we have
to work with in designing a useful emitter junction. However, in the HBT
there is an additional factor in which the band gap difference ∆Eg between
the wide band gap emitter and the narrow band gap base appears in an exponential factor. As a result, a relatively small value of ∆Eg in the exponential
term can dominate Eq. (7–80). This allows us to choose the doping terms

for lower base resistance and emitter junction capacitance. In particular, we
can choose a heavily doped base to reduce the base resistance and a lightly
doped emitter to reduce junction capacitance.
The heterojunction shown in Fig. 7–26 has a smooth barrier, without
the spike and notch commonly observed for heterojunctions (see Fig. 5–46).
It is possible to smooth out such discontinuities in the bands by grading the
composition of the ternary or quaternary alloy between the two materials
(Fig. 7–27). Clearly, grading out the conduction band spike improves the electron injection by reducing the barrier that electrons must overcome. There
are some HBT designs, however, that make use of the spike as a “launching
ramp” to inject hot electrons into the base.422 Chapter 7
Materials commonly used in HBTs obviously include the AlGaAs/GaAs
system because of its wide range of lattice-matched composition. In addition,
the InGaAsP system (including In0.53Ga0.47As) grown on InP has become
popular in HBT design. It is also possible to make HBTs using elemental
semiconductor heterostructures such as Si/Si1 - xGex. In this material system,
the band gap difference ∆Eg between the Si emitter and the narrower band
gap Si1-xGex base occurs primarily in the valence band. As a result, a rather
small addition of Ge to the base results in higher electron injection efficiency
than is possible in homojunction silicon bipolar transistors.
If the SiGe alloy composition in the base of an n-p-n is varied such
that E
g decreases slightly from the emitter side to the collector side of the
base, a built-in electric field accelerates electrons through the base region
(Fig. 7–27). The resulting field-aided base transport is a major advantage of
the HBT. Such graded Ge profiles make the structure more manufacturable,
because one does not have to worry about a mismatch between the p-n junction and the heterojunction.

summary 7.1 A BJT consists of an emitter-base (EB) diode connected back to back to a
collector-base (CB) diode. In the normal active mode of operation, the EB
junction is forward biased such that carriers injected from the emitter can diffuse across the narrow base and be collected by the reverse-biased CB junction.
7.2 The terminal currents can be determined by solving the drift–diffusion and
continuity equations for a narrow-base diode with suitable boundary conditions. The fraction of the total emitter current that is due to injected carriers
from emitter to base is the emitter injection efficiency and is made close to
unity by doping the emitter much higher than the base. Another elegant way
to increase emitter injection efficiency is to use a larger band gap emitter than
in the base, as in heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT).
7.3 The fraction of the carriers that survives diffusion across the narrow base is the
base transport factor, which is made close to unity by making the base widthBipolar Junction Transistors 423
narrow compared with the diffusion length. The product of emitter injection
efficiency and base transport factor gives the current transfer ratio (IC>IE),
from which one can determine the common-emitter current gain (IC>IB).
Active devices such as BJTs provide power gain.
7.4 Equivalent-circuit models such as Ebers–Moll treat the BJT as two coupled
back-to-back diodes, in parallel with controlled current sources. These diodes
can be forward or reverse biased for switching applications. If they are both
forward biased, the BJT is in a low impedance state (saturation); if they are
both reverse biased, it is in a high impedance state (cutoff).
7.5 A charge control analysis of BJTs is possible (as for other devices) in terms of
the integrated carrier concentration in the base. IC is given by the base charge
divided by the base transit time, while IB is the base charge divided by the carrier lifetime (for unity emitter injection efficiency).
7.6 The Gummel–Poon charge control model gives the current components in
terms of the integrated base and emitter dopant charges (Gummel numbers).
It is more accurate and can handle some second-order effects better than
Ebers–Moll.
7.7 Second-order effects include IC increase due to neutral base narrowing for
increasing CB reverse bias (Early effect), current gain drop at high IC (Kirk
effect), IE crowding at the emitter edges due to series resistance effects, and
BJT breakdown at high biases.
7.1 Given the data of Prob. 5.2, plot the doping profiles Na(x) and Nd(x) for prOBlems
the following double-diffused transistor: The starting wafer is n-type Si
with Nd = 1016 cm - 3; Ns = 5 * 1013 cm - 2 boron atoms are deposited on
the surface, and these atoms are diffused into the wafer at 1100°C for 1 hr
(D = 3 * 10-13 cm2/s for B in Si at 1100°C); then the wafer is placed in a
phosphorus diffusion furnace at 1000°C for 15 min (D = 3 * 10-14 cm2/s for
P in Si at 1000°C). During the emitter diffusion, the surface concentration is
held constant at 5 * 1020 cm-3. You may assume that the base doping profile
does not change appreciably during the emitter diffusion, which takes place at
a lower temperature and for a shorter time. Find the width of the base region
from plots of Na(x) and Nd(x). Hint: Use five-cycle semilog paper and let x vary
from zero to about 1.5 mm in steps that are chosen to be simple multiples of

7.3 Calculate the minority excess hole distribution dp(x)/∆pE in the base of a p-n-p

Consider a BJT with a base transport factor of 1.0 and an emitter injection
efficiency of 0.5.
Calculate roughly by what factor would doubling the base width of a BJT would
increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the emitter injection efficiency and base
transport factor? Repeat for the case of emitter doping increased 5 * =. Explain
with key equations, and assume other BJT parameters remain unchanged!

mode, with an emitter-base voltage of 1V. If the neutral base width is 100
nm, the emitter is 200 nm wide, and we have negligible base recombination,
calculate the emitter current, emitter injection efficiency, and base transport
factor. You can assume electron and hole mobility of 500 and 100 cm2/V@s,
respectively, in the emitter, and 800 and 250 cm2/V@s in the base. The device
gets heated up to 400 K during operation such that ni = 1012 cm-3, and Pr = 15.
Qualitatively sketch the device structure, the carrier concentrations, and the

7.7 In a p-n-p transistor emitter, doping is 5 * 1018/cm3, base doping is 1017/cm3,

the normal active mode, assuming that everything else stays the same. (b) In a
certain BJT, the emitter doping is 100 times greater than the base doping, the
emitter width is 0.1 times the base width, and we can assume both base and
emitter widths to be much shorter than the carrier diffusion lengths Ln and Lp.

Optoelectronic Devices
So far we have primarily concentrated on electronic devices. There is also
a wide variety of very interesting and useful device functions involving the
interaction of photons with semiconductors. These devices provide the optical sources and detectors that allow broadband telecommunications and data
transmission over optical fibers. This important area of device applications
is called optoelectronics. In this chapter we will discuss devices that detect
photons and those that emit photons. Devices that convert optical energy
into electrical energy include photodiodes and solar cells. Emitters of photons include incoherent sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and
coherent sources in the form of lasers.
Objectives
1. Understand solar cells
2. Study photodetectors such as APDs
3. Study incoherent light sources (LEDs) and coherent light sources (lasers)
In Section 4.3.4 we saw that bulk semiconductor samples can be used as
photoconductors by providing a change in conductivity proportional to an
optical generation rate. Often, junction devices can be used to improve the
speed of response and the sensitivity of detectors of optical or high-energy
radiation. Two-terminal devices designed to respond to photon absorption
are called photodiodes. Some photodiodes have extremely high sensitivity
and response speed. Since modern electronics often involves optical as well
as electrical signals, photodiodes serve important functions as electronic
devices. In this section, we shall investigate the response of p-n junctions to
optical generation of electron–hole pairs (EHPs) and discuss a few typical
photodiode detector structures. We shall also consider the very important use
of junctions as solar cells, which convert absorbed optical energy into useful
electrical power.

8.1.1 current and voltage in an illuminated junction
In Chapter 5 we identified the current due to drift of minority carriers across
a junction as a generation current. In particular, carriers generated within
the depletion region W are separated by the junction field, electrons being
collected in the n region and holes in the p region. Also, minority carriers
generated thermally within a diffusion length of each side of the junction
diffuse to the depletion region and are swept to the other side by the electric field. If the junction is uniformly illuminated by photons with hn 7 Eg,
an added generation rate gop (EHP>cm3@s) participates in this current
(Fig. 8–1).The number of holes created per second within a diffusion length
of the transition region on the n side is ALpgop. Similarly ALngop electrons
are generated per second within Lnof xp0 and AWgop carriers are generated
within W. The resulting current due to the collection of these optically generated carriers by the junction is
I
op = qAgop(Lp + Ln + W) (8–1)
If we call the thermally generated current described in Eq. (5–37b) Ith,we can
add the optical generation of Eq. (8–1) to find the total reverse current with
illumination. Since this current is directed from n to p, the diode equation
[Eq. (5–36)] becomes
I = Ith(eqV>kT - 1) - Iop
I = qAaLtpppn + Ltnnnpb(eqV>kT - 1) - qAgop(Lp + Ln + W) (8–2)
Thus the I–V curve is lowered by an amount proportional to the generation rate (Fig. 8–1c). This equation can be considered in two parts—the current described by the usual diode equation and the current due to optical
generation.
When the device is short circuited (V = 0), the terms from the diode
equation cancel in Eq. (8–2), as expected. However, there is a short-circuit

current from n to p equal to Iop. Thus the I–V characteristics of Fig. 8–1c cross
the I-axis at negative values proportional to gop. When there is an open circuit
across the device, I = 0 and the voltage V = Voc is

For the special case of a symmetrical junction, pn = np and tp = tn,we
can rewrite Eq. (8–3a) in terms of the thermal generation rate pn>tn = gth
and the optical generation rate gop. Neglecting generation within W:
V
oc ≃
kT
q

for gop W gth (8–3b)
Actually, the term gth = pn>tn represents the equilibrium thermal generation–
recombination rate. As the minority carrier concentration is increased by
optical generation of EHPs, the lifetime tn becomes shorter, and pn>tn
becomes larger (pn is fixed, for a given Nd and T). Therefore, Voc cannot
increase indefinitely with increased generation rate; in fact, the limit on Voc
is the equilibrium contact potential V0 (Fig. 8–2).This result is to be expected,
since the contact potential is the maximum forward bias that can appear
across a junction. The appearance of a forward voltage across an illuminated
junction is known as the photovoltaic effect.
Depending on the intended application, the photodiode of Fig. 8–1 can
be operated in either the third or fourth quarters of its I–V characteristic. As
Fig. 8–3 illustrates, power is delivered to the device from the external circuit
when the current and junction voltage are both positive or both negative
(first or third quadrants). In the fourth quadrant, however, the junction voltage is positive and the current is negative. In this case power is delivered
from the junction to the external circuit (notice that in the fourth quadrant
the current flows from the negative side of V to the positive side, as in a
battery).

If power is to be extracted from the device, the fourth quadrant is used;

the junction and operate it in the third quadrant. We shall investigate these
applications more closely in the discussion to follow.

8.1.2 solar cells
Since power can be delivered to an external circuit by an illuminated junction, it is possible to convert solar energy into electrical energy. If we consider
the fourth quadrant of Fig. 8–3c, it appears doubtful that much power can be
delivered by an individual device. The voltage is restricted to values less than
the contact potential, which in turn is generally less than the band gap voltage Eg>q. For Si the voltage Voc is less than about 1 V. The current generated
depends on the illuminated area, but typically Iop is in the range 10-100 mA
for a junction with an area of about 1 cm2. However, if many such devices
are used, the resulting power can be significant. In fact, arrays of p-n junction solar cells are currently used to supply electrical power for many space
satellites. Solar cells can supply power for the electronic equipment aboard a
satellite over a long period, which is a distinct advantage over batteries. The
array of junctions can be distributed over the surface of the satellite or can
be contained in solar cell “paddles” attached to the main body of the satellite
(Fig. 8–4a). A 72MW solar cell plant in Italy is shown in Fig. 8–4b.
To utilize a maximum amount of available optical energy, it is necessary to design a solar cell with a large area junction located near the surface
of the device (Fig. 8–5). The planar junction is formed by diffusion or ion
implantation, and the surface is coated with appropriate materials to reduce
reflection and to decrease surface recombination. Many compromises must
be made in solar cell design. In the device shown in Fig. 8–5, for example, the
junction depth d must be less than Lp in the n material to allow holes generated near the surface to diffuse to the junction before they recombine; similarly, the thickness of the p region must be such that electrons generated in
this region can diffuse to the junction before recombination takes place. This
requirement implies a proper match between the electron diffusion length
L
n, the thickness of the p region, and the mean optical penetration depth
1>a [see Eq. (4–2)]. It is desirable to have a large contact potential V0 to
obtain a large photovoltage, and therefore heavy doping is indicated; on the
other hand, long lifetimes are desirable and these are reduced by doping too

heavily. It is important that the series resistance of the device be very small
so that power is not lost to heat due to ohmic losses in the device itself. A
series resistance of only a few ohms can seriously reduce the output power
of a solar cell (Prob. 8.7). Since the area is large, the resistance of the p-type
body of the device can be made small. However, contacts to the thin n
region require special design. If this region is contacted at the edge, current
must flow along the thin n region to the contact, resulting in a large series
resistance. To prevent this effect, the contact can be distributed over the n
surface by providing small contact fingers as in Fig. 8–5b. These narrow contacts serve to reduce the series resistance without interfering appreciably
with the incoming light.436 Chapter 8
Figure 8–6 shows the fourth-quadrant portion of a solar cell characteristic, with Ir plotted upward for the convenience of illustration. The opencircuit voltage Voc and the short-circuit current Isc are determined for a given
light level by the cell properties. The maximum power delivered to a load by
this solar cell occurs when the product VIr is a maximum. Calling these values
of voltage and current Vm and Im, we can see that the maximum delivered
power illustrated by the shaded rectangle in Fig. 8–6 is less than the IscVoc
product. The ratio ImVm>IscVoc is called the fill factor, and is a figure of merit
for solar cell design.
Applications of solar cells are not restricted to outer space. It is possible
to obtain useful power from the sun in terrestrial applications using solar
cells, even though the solar intensity is reduced by the atmosphere. Current
worldwide total power generation capability is ∼15 TW and corresponds
to an annual energy usage of ∼500 quads (1 quad = 1015, or a quadrillion,
BTU), with an annual increase of 1-2,. Of this, ∼ 80, comes from fossil
fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), which will be exhausted in several hundred years. In addition, CO2emissions and global warming have spurred a
renewed interest in “green” sources of energy such as photovoltaics, of which
the current installed capacity worldwide is about 100 GW. About 1 kW>m 2
is available in a particularly sunny location (translating to about 600 TW
potentially available worldwide), but not all of this solar power can be converted to electricity. Much of the photon flux is at energies less than the cell
band gap and is not absorbed. High-energy photons are strongly absorbed,
and the resulting EHPs may recombine at the surface. A well-made singlecrystal Si cell can have about 25, efficiency for solar energy conversion,
providing ∼250 W>m2 of electrical power under full illumination. This is a
modest amount of power per unit solar cell area, considering the cost and
effort involved in fabricating a large area of Si cells. Amorphous Si thin-film
solar cells can be made more cheaply, but have lower efficiencies (∼10,)
because of the defects in the material.
The cost and scalability of photovoltaic technology are of paramount
importance for terrestrial applications. Currently, it costs only about 3 cents

per kWh for electricity generation from fossil fuels, but about 10 times that
amount from amorphous Si solar cells, and the time to recover the investment in photovoltaics is about four years. In terms of scalability, at 10, cell
efficiency, approximately 3, of the land area would have to be covered with
solar cells to meet US energy needs, which would, of course, create other
environmental problems. One approach to obtaining more power per cell
is to focus considerable light onto the cell with the use of mirrors. Although
Si cells lose efficiency at the resulting high temperatures, GaAs and related
compounds can be used at 100°C or higher. In such solar concentrator systems, more effort and expense can be put into the solar cell fabrication, since
fewer cells are required. For example, a GaAs–AlGaAs heterojunction cell
provides good conversion efficiency and operates at the elevated temperatures that are common in solar concentrator systems. In such systems, the
area required is shifted from the cell to the concentrator.

8.1.3 Photodetectors
When the photodiode is operated in the third quadrant of its I–V characteristic (Fig. 8–3b), the current is essentially independent of voltage but is
proportional to the optical generation rate. Such a device provides a useful
means of measuring illumination levels or of converting time-varying optical
signals into electrical signals.
In most optical detection applications the detector’s speed of response,
or bandwidth, is critical. For example, if the photodiode is to respond to a
series of light pulses 1 ns apart, the photogenerated minority carriers must
diffuse to the junction and be swept across to the other side in a time much
less than 1 ns. The carrier diffusion step in this process is time consuming
and should be eliminated if possible. Therefore, it is desirable that the width
of the depletion region W be large enough so that most of the photons are
absorbed within W rather than in the neutral p and n regions. When an EHP
is created in the depletion region, the electric field sweeps the electron to
the n side and the hole to the p side. Since this carrier drift occurs in a very
short time, the response of the photodiode can be quite fast. When the carriers are generated primarily within the depletion layer W, the detector is
called a depletion layer photodiode. Obviously, it is desirable to dope at least438 Chapter 8
one side of the junction lightly so that W can be made large. The appropriate width for W is chosen as a compromise between sensitivity and speed
of response. If W is wide, most of the incident photons will be absorbed in
the depletion region, leading to a high sensitivity. Also, a wide W results in
a small junction capacitance [see Eq. (5–62)], thereby reducing the RC time
constant of the detector circuit. On the other hand, W must not be so wide
that the time required for drift of photogenerated carriers out of the depletion region is excessive, leading to low bandwidth.
One convenient method of controlling the width of the depletion
region is to build a p-i-n photodetector (Fig. 8–7).The “i” region need not be
truly intrinsic, as long as the resistivity is high. It can be grown epitaxially on
the n-type substrate, and the p region can be obtained by implantation. When
this device is reverse biased, the applied voltage appears almost entirely
across the i region. If the carrier lifetime within the i region is long compared
with the drift time, most of the photogenerated carriers will be collected by
the n and p regions. An important figure of merit for a photodetector is the
external quantum efficiency hQ, defined as the number of carriers that are
collected for every photon impinging on the detector. For a photocurrent
density Jop, we collect Jop>q carriers per unit area per second. For an incident
optical power density of Pop, the number of photons shining on the detector
per unit area per second is Pop>hv. Therefore,
hQ = (Jop>q)>(Pop>hv) (8–4)
For a photodiode that has no current gain, the maximum hQ is unity. If
low-level optical signals are to be detected, it is often desirable to operate
the photodiode in the avalanche region of its characteristic. In this mode,
each photogenerated carrier results in a significant change in the current
because of avalanche multiplication, leading to gain and external quantum
efficiencies of greater than 100,. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are useful
as detectors in fiber-optic systems (Section 8.2.2).
The type of photodiode described here is sensitive to photons with
energies near the band gap energy (intrinsic detectors). If hn is less than Eg,
the photons will not be absorbed; on the other hand, if the photons are
much more energetic than Eg, they will be absorbed very near the surface,

where the recombination rate is high. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a
photodiode material with a band gap corresponding to a particular region
of the spectrum. Detectors sensitive to longer wavelengths can be designed
such that photons can excite electrons into or out of impurity levels (extrinsic
detectors). However, the sensitivity of such extrinsic detectors is much less
than intrinsic detectors, where EHPs are generated by excitation across the
band gap.
By using lattice-matched multilayers of compound semiconductors, the
band gap of the absorbing region can be tailored to match the wavelength of
light being detected. Wider band gap material can then be used as a window
through which the light is transmitted to the absorbing region (Fig. 8–8).
For example, we saw in Fig. 1–13 that InGaAs with an In mole fraction of
53, can be grown epitaxially on InP with excellent lattice-matching. This
composition of InGaAs has a band gap of about 0.75 eV, which is sensitive
to a useful wavelength for fiber-optic systems (1.55 mm), as we shall see in
Section 8.2.2. In making a photodiode using InGaAs as the active material,
it is possible to bring the light through the wider band gap In0.52Al0.48As
(also lattice-matched to InP), thus greatly reducing surface recombination
effects. In the case of APDs requiring narrow-band-gap material, it is often
advantageous to absorb the light in the narrow-gap semiconductor (e.g.,
InGaAs) and transport the resulting carriers to a junction made in wider
band gap material (e.g., InAlAs), where the avalanche multiplication takes
place at high fields. Such a separation of the absorption and multiplication APDs avoids the excessive leakage currents typical of reverse-biased
junctions in narrow-gap materials. In this particular structure, there is also
a doped InAlAs charge layer, leading to a SACM APD, which helps optimize (decrease) the electric field further between the multiplication and
absorption regions. In certain APDs, one can grade the alloy composition
between the high-band-gap multiplication regions and the lower-band-gap
absorption region to avoid any band-edge discontinuities, which can trap
photogenerated carriers. The photocurrent and dark current both increase
with bias because of avalanche multiplication (Fig. 8–8b). One obviously
wants to maximize the difference ∆I between the photocurrent Ip and the
dark current Id. The ratio of ∆I at different voltages to that at a low reference
voltage is defined as the gain of the APD.
8.1.4 Gain, bandwidth, and signal-to-noise Ratio of Photodetectors
In optical communication systems, the sensitivity (which depends on gain) of
the photodetector and its response time (bandwidth) are of critical importance. Typical gain–bandwidth characteristics of such a SACM APD are
shown in Fig. 8–8c and are limited by the transit time of carriers through
the structure. Unfortunately, designs that increase gain tend to decrease
bandwidth and vice versa. It is common to express the gain–bandwidth
product as a figure of merit for detectors. In a p-i-n diode, there is no gain
mechanism, since at most one EHP is collected by the junction for each
photon absorbed. Thus, the gain is essentially unity, and the gain–bandwidth440 Chapter 8
product is determined by the bandwidth, or frequency response. In a p-i-n,
the response time is dependent on the width of the depletion region.
Another important property of detectors is the signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio, which is the amount of usable information compared with the

background noise in the detector. In the case of photoconductors, the major
source of noise is random thermal motion of the carriers, leading to fluctuations in the dark current (called Johnson noise). The noise current increases
with temperature (∼kT) and with the conductance of the material in the
dark. Therefore, the photoconductor noise at a given temperature can be
reduced by increasing the dark resistance. Yet another source of noise at low
frequencies is 1>f or flicker noise, due to carrier trapping and detrapping at
defects.
In a p-i-n diode, the dark current is smaller and the dark resistance
much higher than in a photoconductor, and the main source of noise is random thermal generation–recombination of EHPs within this region (called
shot noise). The shot noise is ultimately due to the quantization of the charge
of electrons and holes. The noise in a p-i-n device is considerably lower than
that in a photoconductor, as well as in APDs, for reasons described next.
Avalanche photodiodes have the advantage of providing gain through
the avalanche multiplication effect. The disadvantage is increased noise relative to the p-i-n, due to random fluctuations in the avalanche process. This
noise is reduced if the impact ionization in the high-field region is due to
only one type of carrier, since more fluctuations in the ionization process
occur when both electrons and holes participate. In Si, the ability of electrons to create EHPs in an impact ionization event is much higher than for
holes. Therefore, Si APDs can be operated with high gain and relatively low
noise. Unfortunately, Si APDs cannot be used for most fiber-optic transmission because Si is transparent at the wavelengths of low loss and low
dispersion (l = 1.55 and 1.3 mm) for optical fibers. For these longer wavelengths, In0.53Ga0.47As has become the material of choice. However, the ionization rates of electrons and holes in most compound semiconductors are
comparable, which degrades their noise and frequency response relative to
Si APDs.
The various sources of noise determine the S>N ratio in a photodetector. One quantifies it as a noise-equivalent power (NEP), which is the
minimum detectable signal that would produce the same rms output as the
noise. The detectivity of the photodetector is then defined as D = 1>NEP.
The NEP depends on the area of the photodetector as well as the bandwidth. The specific detectivity, D*, is then defined as that for a detector of
unit area and a bandwidth of 1 Hz. Clearly, once the bandwidth requirements
are met, it is desirable to choose a photodetector with the highest D*.
Another approach that has demonstrated excellent performance in
terms of both high sensitivity and bandwidth utilizes a waveguide structure
(Fig. 8–9). Here, unlike the situation with the p-i-n photodiode (Fig. 8–7) or
the APD (Fig. 8–8), the light strikes the photodiode perpendicular to the
current transport. The advantage is that now the absorption region can be
made quite long, along the photon path, leading to high sensitivity, while
at the same time the photogenerated carriers have to traverse a short distance in the perpendicular direction, leading to short transit times and high
bandwidth.442 Chapter 8

Schematic of a waveguide photodiode. The photons are strongly absorbed in the narrow-band-gap
InGaAs region A, and carriers are multiplied by the avalanche process in region M. The charge region
C helps optimize the electric field profile between A and M.
When carriers are injected across a forward-biased junction, the current is
usually accounted for by recombination in the transition region and in the
neutral regions near the junction. In a semiconductor with an indirect band
gap, such as Si or Ge, the recombination releases heat to the lattice. On the
other hand, in a material characterized by direct recombination, considerable
light may be given off from the junction under forward bias. This effect, called
injection electroluminescence (Section 4.2.2), provides an important application of diodes as generators of light. The use of LEDs in digital displays is well
known. There are also other important applications, in traffic and automotive
signals and in illumination. Another important device making use of radiative
recombination in a forward-biased p-n junction is the semiconductor laser. As
we shall see in Section 8.4, lasers emit coherent light in much narrower wavelength bands than LEDs, with more collimation (directionality), and are very
useful for fiber-optic communication systems, as described in Section 8.2.2.
For LEDs, the frequency (color) of the photon is governed by the band
gap of the semiconductor as given by the Planck relation, hn = Eg, which,
in appropriate units, can be expressed as Eg (eV) = 1.24/l (om). A very
important metric of an LED is the external quantum efficiency hext, which
is defined as the light output divided by the electrical input power:
hext = (Internal radiative efficiency) * (Extraction efficiency) (8–5)
The internal efficiency is a function of the quality of the material and the
structure and composition of the layer. Defects in the material will clearly

lead to nonradiative recombination. However, even if the internal efficiency
is high, not all emitted photons are extracted from the LED. The emitted
photons from an LED have a wide angular distribution, unlike those in a
laser. For example, if an LED had a planar surface, the photons incident on
the semiconductor–air interface at angles greater than a critical angle would
undergo total internal reflection and ultimately be lost via absorption within
the semiconductor. Hence, typically, LEDs are made with a dome-type encapsulation, which acts as a lens so that more of the photons can be extracted.
8.2.1 light-emitting materials
The band gaps of various binary compound semiconductors are illustrated in
Fig. 4–4 relative to the spectrum. There is a wide variation in band gaps and,
therefore, in available photon energies, extending from the ultraviolet (GaN,
3.4 eV) into the infrared (InSb, 0.18 eV). In fact, by utilizing ternary and
quaternary compounds the number of available energies can be increased
significantly (see Figs. 1–13 and 3–6). A good example of the variation in
photon energy obtainable from the compound semiconductors is the ternary
alloy gallium arsenide–phosphide, which is illustrated in Fig. 8–10.When the
percentage of As is reduced and P is increased in this material, the resulting
band gap varies from the direct 1.43-eV gap of GaAs (infrared) to the indirect 2.26-eV gap of GaP (green). The band gap of GaAs1-xPx varies almost
linearly with x until the 0.45 composition is reached, and electron–hole
recombination is direct over this range. The most common alloy composition used in red LED displays is x ≃ 0.4. For this composition the band gap
is direct, since the Γ minimum (at k = 0) is the lowest part of the conduction band. This results in efficient radiative recombination, and the emitted
photons (∼1.9 eV) are in the red portion of the spectrum.
For GaAs1-xPx with P concentrations above 45 percent, the band gap
is due to the indirect X minimum. Radiative recombination in such indirect
materials is generally unlikely, because electrons in the conduction band
have different momentum from holes in the valence band (see Fig. 3–5).
Interestingly, however, indirect GaAs1-xPx (including GaP, x = 1) doped
with nitrogen can be used in LEDs with light output in the yellow to green
portions of the spectrum. This is possible because the nitrogen impurity binds
an electron very tightly. This confinement in real space (∆x) means that the
electron momentum is spread out in momentum space ∆p by the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle [see Eq. (2–18)]. As a result, the momentum conservation rules, which generally prevent radiative recombination in indirect materials, are circumvented. Thus nitrogen doping of GaAs1-xPx is not only useful
technologically, but also provides an interesting and practical illustration of
the uncertainty principle.
In many applications light from a laser or an LED need not be visible
to the eye. Infrared emitters such as GaAs, InP, and mixed alloys of these
compounds are particularly well suited to fiber-optical communication systems or TV remote controls. For example, a laser or LED can be used in444 Chapter 8
conjunction with a photodiode or other photosensitive device to transmit
information optically between locations. By varying the current through the
diode, the light output can be modulated such that analog or digital information appears in the optical signal directed at the detector. Alternatively,
the information may be introduced between the source and detector. For
example, a semiconductor laser-photodetector arrangement can be used in
a compact disc or DVD system for reading digital information from the
spinning disc. A light emitter and a photodiode form an optoelectronic pair,
which provides complete electrical isolation between input and output, since
the only link between the two devices is optical. In an optoelectronic isolator,
both devices may be mounted on a ceramic substrate and packaged together
to form a unit that passes information while maintaining isolation.

In view of the broad range of applications requiring semiconductor
lasers and LEDs with visible and infrared wavelengths, the wide variety of
available III–V materials is extremely useful. In addition to the AlGaAs
and GaAsP systems shown in Fig. 3–6 and Fig. 8–10, the InAlGaP system
is useful for red, yellow, and orange wavelengths, and AlGaInN is a strong
emitter in the blue and green. Why is there so much interest in short wavelength emitters such as blue-green LEDs? As shown in Fig. 8–11, moderate efficiency (∼10 lumens>watt) red, green, and yellow-green LEDs have
existed for a long time in the GaAsP system, based on concepts such as
N isoelectronic doping. More recently, in the mid-1990s, much higher brightness and efficiency (∼30 lumens>watt) red-orange-yellow LEDs based on
the InAlGaP system have been developed. The higher-band-gap InAlGaN
system has direct band gaps over the entire alloy composition range and
hence offers highly efficient light emission in the blue and green part of
the spectrum. A major goal of the optoelectronics community has been the
achievement of high-efficiency red, green, and blue emitters, because those
colors are the three primary colors of the spectrum. By combining these color
LEDs (or in conjunction with suitable phosphors), one can form intense
white light sources (∼500 lumens) with luminous efficiencies ∼ 2 times
greater than those of conventional incandescent lightbulbs. Since generalpurpose illumination typically requires kilolumens of light, it may be practical to combine a few of these high-brightness LEDs for that purpose. They

also have much longer lifetimes (5,000 –100,000 hours versus 2,000 hours
for conventional lightbulbs) and much higher energy efficiencies. The costs
of these LEDs have been reduced considerably in recent years, making them
more competitive. Continued application of these LEDs in lighting can lead
to a significant reduction in global energy demand. Arrays of red, green, and
blue emitters are being used in outdoor displays and TV screens, as well as
in automotive taillights and signal lights. Red, yellow, and green LEDs are
being used for traffic lights because they have a much higher reliability and
lifetime than conventional lightbulbs, and they save energy.
For many years an efficient blue emitter was elusive, because materials with wide band gap also tend to require crystal growth at high temperatures. Therefore, they are difficult to grow on convenient substrates. An
excellent candidate in terms of band gap is GaN, which has Eg corresponding to the ultraviolet. Unfortunately, deposition of GaN by MOCVD or
other methods requires a substrate that can withstand high temperatures. A
convenient substrate is sapphire, which has a melting point above 2000oC.
However, there is considerable lattice mismatch between sapphire and
GaN, and epitaxial GaN films suffer from dislocations that thread from the
sapphire-GaN interface through the film. These threading dislocations can
serve as nonradiative EHP recombination sites where carriers recombine
with their energy given up as heat rather than light. This is not good news for
an LED material, and for many years GaN films were inefficient light emitters. As sometimes happens (too bad it’s not more often), nature provides a
way around a problem that seems insurmountable. In this case it turns out
that addition of In during the growth of the GaN film provides a way to
avoid catastrophic loss of carriers at dislocations. Since In is not completely
miscible in GaN, In-rich clusters form in InGaN which have a smaller band
gap than the rest of the film. Therefore, carriers diffusing through the InGaN
can fall into the potential well of the lower band gap cluster and recombine
radiatively. If the density of such low-bandgap clusters significantly outnumbers the density of threading dislocations, many of the electron-hole pairs
can survive to recombine giving off light. This discovery revolutionized the
search for wide-bandgap materials to allow light emission in the blue and
violet spectra. White light can be obtained by combining red, green, and blue
emitters or by coating a blue or violet emitter with phosphors that can reemit
various wavelengths to achieve white light. In recent years these white LED
have been engineered to be extremely efficient, allowing the application of
such high brightness LEDs in lighting applications.
One problem that is faced with LEDs is that many of the photons that
are generated cannot be extracted from the device if it is a planar structure. The reason is that the semiconductor has a higher refractive index than
the surrounding (air) medium, and for a light ray impinging on the surface
at greater than the critical angle, it undergoes total internal reflection, and
is re-absorbed. Hence, it is important to texture the surface of the LEDs
to create micro-lenses such that a larger fraction of the light rays can be
extracted. There are also important packaging challenges to dissipate heatOptoelectronic Devices 447
from the devices by creating proper heat sinks. Therefore, considerable
device engineering has been applied to the design of these devices in recent
years, and the results have been impressive in terms of lumens out for a given
power into the LED. Finally, after many years of work by crystal growers,
device designers and packaging engineers, LEDs have become widespread
in lighting as well as in displays.
8.2.2 Fiber-Optic communications
The transmission of optical signals from source to detector can be greatly
enhanced if an optical fiber is placed between the light source and the detector. An optical fiber is essentially a “light pipe” or waveguide for optical
frequencies. The fiber is typically drawn from a boule of glass to a diameter
of ∼25 om. The fine glass fiber is relatively flexible and can be used to guide
optical signals over distances of kilometers without the necessity of perfect alignment between source and detector. This significantly increases the
applications of optical communication in areas such as telephone and data
transmission.
One type of optical fiber has an outer layer of very pure fused silica
(SiO2), with a core of germanium doped glass having a higher index of refraction (Fig. 8–12a).1 Such a step-index fiber maintains the light beam primarily in the central core with little loss at the surface. The light is transmitted
along the length of the fiber by internal reflection at the step in the refractive
index.
1The index of refraction (or refractive index) n compares the velocity of light v in the material with its
velocity c in a vacuum: n = c>v. Thus, if n1 7 n2 in Fig. 8–12a, the velocity of light is greater in material
2 than in 1. The value of n varies somewhat with the wavelength of light.

Losses in the fiber at a given wavelength can be described by an attenuation coefficient A [similar to the absorption coefficient of Eq. (4–3)]. The
intensity of the signal at a distance x along the fiber is then related to the
starting intensity by the usual expression.
I(x) = I0e-ax (8–6)
The attenuation is not the same for all wavelengths, however, and it is
therefore important to choose a signal wavelength carefully. A plot of A
vs. l for a typical silica glass fiber is shown in Fig. 8–13. It is clear that dips
in A near 1.3 and 1.55 mm provide “windows” in the attenuation, which
can be exploited to reduce the degradation of signals. The overall decrease
in attenuation with increasing wavelength is due to the reduced scattering from small random inhomogeneities which result in fluctuations of
the refractive index on a scale comparable to the wavelength. This type
of attenuation, called Rayleigh scattering, decreases with the fourth power
of wavelength. This effect is observed at sunrise and sunset, when attenuation of short wavelength blue and green light results in red and orange
sunlight. Obviously, Rayleigh scattering encourages operation at long wavelengths in fiber-optic systems. However, a competing process of infrared
absorption dominates for wavelengths longer than about 1.7 om, due to
vibrational excitation of the atoms making up the glass. Therefore, a useful minimum in absorption for silica fibers occurs at about 1.55 om, where
epitaxial layers in the (In, Ga) (As, P) system can be grown lattice-matched
to InP substrates (see Fig. 1–13).
Another consideration in choice of operating wavelength is the pulse
dispersion, or spreading of data pulses as they propagate down the fiber. This

effect can be caused by the wavelength dependence of the refractive index,
causing different optical frequencies to travel down the fiber with slightly
different velocities. This effect, called chromatic dispersion, is much less pronounced at the 1.3 om window in Fig. 8–13.Another cause of dispersion is the
fact that different modes propagate with different path lengths (Fig. 8–12a).
This type of dispersion can be reduced by grading the refractive index of the
core (Fig. 8–12b) such that various modes are continually refocused, reducing
the differences in path lengths.
The light source in a fiber-optic system today is a laser, because the
light is made up of essentially a single frequency and allows a very large
information bandwidth. (Semiconductor lasers suitable for fiber-optic communications will be discussed in Section 8.4.) In early optoelectronic systems
for fiber optics, it was most convenient to use the well-established GaAs–
AlGaAs system for making lasers and LEDs. These light sources are highly
efficient, and good detectors can be made using Si p-i-n or APDs. However,
these sources operate in the wavelength range near 0.9 om, where the attenuation is greater than that for longer wavelengths. Modern systems, therefore, operate near the 1.3- and 1.55 om minima shown in Fig. 8–13. At these
wavelengths, lasers can be made by using InGaAs or InGaAsP grown on InP,
and detectors can be made of the same materials (see Fig. 8–8).
Multimode fibers are larger (∼25 om in diameter) than single-mode
fibers (∼ 5 om) and transmit a coherent laser beam. By forming numerous optical fibers into a bundle, with an appropriate jacket for mechanical
strength, an enormous amount of information can be transmitted over long
distances.2 Depending upon the losses in the fibers, repeater stations may be
required periodically along the path. Thus, many photodetectors and laser
sources are required in a fiber-optic system. Semiconductor device development, including appropriate binary, ternary, and quaternary compounds for
both emitters and detectors, is therefore crucial to the successful implementation of such optical communications systems. A schematic of a fiber-optic
transmission system is shown in Fig. 8–14.
2Transmission rates of 40 Gbit>s are becoming standard, but even higher rates of 400 Gbit>s have
been achieved using ultradense-wavelength-division multiplexing (UDWDM). This approach uses slightly
different wavelengths or colors to carry different channels of information along the same fiber. As a
convenient calibration of the 40 G bit>s rate, it is worth noting that the human eye is able to transmit about
1 G bit>s to the brain.

The word LASER is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, which sums up the operation of an important optical and
electronic device. The laser is a source of highly directional, monochromatic,
coherent light, and as such it has revolutionized some longstanding optical
problems and has created some new fields of basic and applied optics. The
light from a laser, depending on the type, can be a continuous beam of low
or medium power, or it can be a short burst of intense light delivering millions of watts. Light has always been a primary communications link between
humans and the environment, but until the invention of the laser, the light
sources available for transmitting information and performing experiments
were generally neither monochromatic nor coherent, and were of relatively
low intensity. Thus the laser is of great interest in optics; but it is equally
important in optoelectronics, particularly in fiber-optic communications. The
last three letters in the word laser are intended to imply how the device operates: by the stimulated emission of radiation. In Chapter 2 we discussed the
emission of radiation when excited electrons fall to lower energy states; but
generally, these processes occur randomly and can therefore be classed as
spontaneous emission. This means that the rate at which electrons fall from
an upper level of energy E2 to a lower level E1 is at every instant proportional
to the number of electrons remaining in E2 (the population of E2). Thus if an

signal with repeaters to compensate for fiber loss. Switching circuits route signals appropriately. After
the optical signal is transformed to an electrical output by a photodetector and a low-noise preamplifier
(LNA), it is converted to an analog signal, once distortions of the digital signals due to propagation
through the fiber have been corrected with the use of a “regenerator.”

initial electron population in E2 were allowed to decay, we would expect an
exponential emptying of the electrons to the lower energy level, with a mean
decay time describing how much time an average electron spends in the
upper level. An electron in a higher or excited state need not wait for spontaneous emission to occur, however; if conditions are right, it can be stimulated
to fall to the lower level and emit its photon in a time much shorter than
its mean spontaneous decay time. The stimulus is provided by the presence
of photons of the proper wavelength. Let us visualize an electron in state
E2 waiting to drop spontaneously to E1 with the emission of a photon of
energy hn12 = E2 - E1 (Fig. 8–15). Now we assume that this electron in the
upper state is immersed in an intense field of photons, each having energy
hn12 = E2 - E1, and in phase with the other photons. The electron is induced
to drop in energy from E2 to E1, contributing a photon whose wave is in
phase with the radiation field. If this process continues and other electrons
are stimulated to emit photons in the same fashion, a large radiation field can
build up. This radiation will be monochromatic since each photon will have
an energy of precisely hn12 = E2 - E1 and will be coherent, because all the
photons released will be in phase and reinforcing. This process of stimulated
emission can be described quantum mechanically to relate the probability of
emission to the intensity of the radiation field. Without quantum mechanics
we can make a few observations here about the relative rates at which the
absorption and emission processes occur. Let us assume the instantaneous
populations of E1 and E2 to be n1 and n2, respectively. We know from earlier
discussions of distributions and the Boltzmann factor that at thermal equilibrium the relative population will be

= e-(E2 - E1)>kT = e-hn12>kT (8–7)
if the two levels contain an equal number of available states.
The negative exponent in this equation indicates that n2 V n1 at equilibrium; that is, most electrons are in the lower energy level as expected. If
the atoms exist in a radiation field of photons with energy hn12, such that the
energy density of the field is t(n12),3 then stimulated emission can occur along

with absorption and spontaneous emission. The rate of stimulated emission
is proportional to the instantaneous number of electrons in the upper level
n2 and to the energy density of the stimulating field t(n12). Thus we can write
the stimulated emission rate as B21n2 t(n12), where B21 is a proportionality
factor. The rate at which the electrons in E1 absorb photons should also
be proportional to t(n12), and to the electron population in E1. Therefore,
the absorption rate is B12n1t(n12), where B12 is a proportionality factor for
absorption. Finally, the rate of spontaneous emission is proportional only
to the population of the upper level. Introducing still another coefficient,
we can write the rate of spontaneous emission as A21n2. For steady state the
two emission rates must balance the rate of absorption to maintain constant
populations n1 and n2 (Fig. 8–16).

This relation was described by Einstein, and the coefficients B12, A21, B21 are
called the Einstein coefficients. We notice from Eq. (8–8a) that no energy density t is required to cause a transition from an upper to a lower state; spontaneous emission occurs without an energy density to drive it. The reverse is
not true, however; exciting an electron to a higher state (absorption) requires
the application of energy, as we would expect thermodynamically.
At equilibrium, the ratio of the stimulated to spontaneous emission
rates is generally very small, and the contribution of stimulated emission is
negligible. With a photon field present,

As Eq. (8–8b) indicates, the way to enhance the stimulated emission over
spontaneous emission is to have a very large photon field energy density
r(n12). In the laser, this is encouraged by providing an optical resonant cavity
in which the photon density can build up to a large value through multiple
internal reflections at certain frequencies (n).

Similarly, to obtain more stimulated emission than absorption we must
have n2 7 n1:

(8–9)
Thus if stimulated emission is to dominate over absorption of photons from
the radiation field, we must have a way of maintaining more electrons in
the upper level than in the lower level. This condition is quite unnatural,
since Eq. (8–7) indicates that n2 >n1 is less than unity for any equilibrium
case. Because of its unusual nature, the condition n2 7 n1 is called population inversion. It is also referred to as a condition of negative temperature. This
rather startling terminology emphasizes the nonequilibrium nature of population inversion, and refers to the fact that the ratio n2 >n1 in Eq. (8–7) could
be larger than unity only if the temperature were negative. Of course, this
manner of speaking does not imply anything about temperature in the usual
sense of that word. The fact is that Eq. (8–7) is a thermal equilibrium equation and cannot be applied to the situation of population inversion without
invoking the concept of negative temperature.
In summary, Eqs. (8–8b) and (8–9) indicate that if the photon density
is to build up through a predominance of stimulated emission over both
spontaneous emission and absorption, two requirements must be met. We
must provide (1) an optical resonant cavity to encourage the photon field to
build up and (2) a means of obtaining population inversion.
An optical resonant cavity can be obtained using reflecting mirrors
to reflect the photons back and forth, allowing the photon energy density
to build up. One or both of the end mirrors are constructed to be partially
transmitting so that a fraction of the light will “leak out” of the resonant
system. This transmitted light is the output of the laser. Of course, in designing such a laser one must choose the amount of transmission to be a small
perturbation on the resonant system. The gain in photons per pass between
the end plates must be larger than the transmission at the ends, scattering
from impurities, absorption, and other losses. The arrangement of parallel
plates providing multiple internal reflections is similar to that used in the
Fabry–Perot interferometer;4 thus the reflecting ends of the laser cavity are
often referred to as Fabry–Perot faces. As Fig. 8–17 indicates, light of a particular frequency can be reflected back and forth within the resonant cavity
in a reinforcing (coherent) manner if an integral number of half-wavelengths
fit between the end mirrors. Thus the length of the cavity for stimulated
emission must be
L =
ml
2 (8–10)
4Interferometers are discussed in many sophomore physics texts.454 Chapter 8
where m is an integer. In this equation l is the photon wavelength within the
laser material. If we wish to use the wavelength l0 of the output light in the
atmosphere (often taken as the vacuum value), the index of refraction n of
the laser material must be considered
l0 = ln (8–11)
In practice, L W l, and Eq. (8–10) is automatically satisfied over some
portion of the mirror. An important exception occurs in the vertical cavity
surface-emitting lasers discussed in Section 8.4.4, for which the cavity length
is comparable to the wavelength.
There are ways of obtaining population inversion in the atomic levels
of many solids, liquids, and gases, and in the energy bands of semiconductors. Thus the possibilities for laser systems with various materials are quite
extensive. An early laser system used a ruby rod. In gas lasers, electrons
are excited to metastable levels in molecules to achieve population inversion. These are interesting and useful laser systems, but in view of our emphasis on semiconductor devices in this book, we will move to the description
of semiconductor lasers.

The laser became an important part of semiconductor device technology
in 1962 when the first p-n junction lasers were built in GaAs (infrared)5
and GaAsP (visible).6 We have already discussed the incoherent light emission from p-n junctions (LEDs), generated by the spontaneous recombination of electrons and holes injected across the junction. In this section
we shall concentrate on the requirements for population inversion due to
these injected carriers and the nature of the coherent light from p-n junctionOptoelectronic Devices 455
lasers. These devices differ from solid, gas, and liquid lasers in several important respects. Junction lasers are remarkably small (typically on the order of
0.1 * 0.1 * 0.3 mm), they exhibit high efficiency, and the laser output is easily
modulated by controlling the junction current. Semiconductor lasers operate
at low power compared, for example, with ruby or CO2 lasers; on the other
hand, these junction lasers compete with He–Ne lasers in power output.Thus
the function of the semiconductor laser is to provide a portable and easily controlled source of low-power coherent radiation. They are particularly
suitable for fiber-optic communication systems (Section 8.2.2).
8.4.1 Population inversion at a junction
If a p-n junction is formed between degenerate materials, the bands under
forward bias appear as shown in Fig. 8–18. If the bias (and thus the current)
is large enough, electrons and holes are injected into and across the transition region in considerable concentrations. As a result, the region about the
junction is far from being depleted of carriers. This region contains a large
concentration of electrons within the conduction band and a large concentration of holes within the valence band. If these population densities are high
enough, a condition of population inversion results, and the region about the
junction over which it occurs is called an inversion region.7
Population inversion at a junction is best described by the use of the
concept of quasi-Fermi levels (Section 4.3.3). Since the forward-biased condition of Fig. 8–18 is a distinctly nonequilibrium state, the equilibrium equations
defining the Fermi level are not applicable. In particular, the concentration
of electrons in the inversion region (and for several diffusion lengths into
the p material) is larger than equilibrium statistics would imply; the same is
also true for the injected holes in the n material. We can use Eq. (4–15) to
describe the carrier concentrations in terms of the quasi-Fermi levels for
electrons and holes in steady state. Thus

n = N
ce-(Ec - Fn)>kT = nie(Fn - Ei)>kT (8–12a)
p = Nve-(Fp - Ev)>kT = nie(Ei - Fp)>kT (8–12b)
Using Eqs. (8–12a) and (b), we can draw Fn and Fp on any band diagram for which we know the electron and hole distributions. For example, in
Fig. 8–18, Fn in the neutral n region is essentially the same as the equilibrium
Fermi level EFn. This is true to the extent that the electron concentration on
the n side is equal to its equilibrium value. However, since large numbers of
electrons are injected across the junction, the electron concentration begins
at a high value near the junction and decays exponentially to its equilibrium
value n
p deep in the p material. Therefore, Fn drops from EFn as shown in
Fig. 8–18. We notice that, deep in the neutral regions, the quasi-Fermi levels
are essentially equal. The separation of Fn and Fp at any point is a measure
of the departure from equilibrium at that point. Obviously, this departure
is considerable in the inversion region, since Fn and Fp are separated by an
energy greater than the band gap (Fig. 8–19).
Unlike the case of the two-level system discussed in Section 8.3, the
condition for population inversion in semiconductors must take into account
the distribution of energies available for transitions between the bands. The
basic definition of population inversion holds—for dominance of stimulated emission between two energy levels separated by energy hn, the electron population of the upper level must be greater than that of the lower
level. The unusual aspect of a semiconductor is that bands of levels are available for such transitions. Population inversion obviously exists for transitions
between the bottom of the conduction band E
c and the top of the valence
band E
v in Fig. 8–19. In fact, transitions between levels in the conduction
band up to Fn and levels in the valence band down to Fp take place under
conditions of population inversion. For any given transition energy hn in a
semiconductor, population inversion exists when

When F
n and Fp lie within their respective bands (as in Fig. 8–19),
stimulated emission can dominate over a range of transitions, from
hn = (Fn - Fp) to h n = Eg. As we shall see below, the dominant transitions
for laser action are determined largely by the resonant cavity and the strong
recombination radiation occurring near hn = Eg.
In choosing a material for junction laser fabrication, it is necessary
that electron–hole recombination occur directly, rather than through trapping processes such as are dominant in Si or Ge. Gallium arsenide is an
example of such a “direct” semiconductor. Furthermore, we must be able
to dope the material n-type or p-type to form a junction. If an appropriate
resonant cavity can be constructed in the junction region, a laser results in
which population inversion is accomplished by the bias current applied to
the junction (Fig. 8–20).
8.4.2 emission spectra for p-n junction lasers
Under forward bias, an inversion layer can be obtained along the plane of the
junction, where a large population of electrons exists at the same location as
a large hole population. A second look at Fig. 8–19 indicates that spontaneous emission of photons can occur due to direct recombination of electrons
and holes, releasing energies ranging from approximately Fn - Fp to Eg.
That is, an electron can recombine over an energy from Fnto Fp, yielding
a photon of energy hn = Fn - Fp, or an electron can recombine from the
bottom of the conduction band to the top of the valence band, releasing a
photon with h n = Ec - Ev = Eg. These two energies serve as the approximate outside limits of the laser spectra.
The photon wavelengths which participate in stimulated emission are
determined by the length of the resonant cavity as in Eq. (8–10). Figure 8–21
illustrates a typical plot of emission intensity vs. photon energy for a semiconductor laser. At low current levels (Fig. 8–21a), a spontaneous emission spectrum containing energies in the range Eg 6 h n 6 (Fn - Fp) is obtained. As
the current is increased to the point that significant population inversion
exists, stimulated emission occurs at frequencies corresponding to the cavity modes as shown in Fig. 8–21b. These modes correspond to successive
numbers of integral half-wavelengths fitted within the cavity, as described by
Eq. (8–10). Finally, at a still higher current level, a most preferred mode or

set of modes will dominate the spectral output (Fig. 8–21c).This very intense
mode represents the main laser output of the device; the output light will be
composed of almost monochromatic radiation superimposed on a relatively
weak radiation background, due primarily to spontaneous emission.
The separation of the modes in Fig. 8–21b is complicated by the fact
that the index of refraction n for GaAs depends on wavelength l. From
Eq. (8–10) we have
m =
2Ln
l0
(8–14)
If m (the number of half-wavelengths in L) is large, we can use the derivative
to find its rate of change with l0:

If we let ∆m = -1, we can calculate the change in wavelength ∆l0 between
adjacent modes (i.e., between modes m and m - 1).
8.4.3 the basic semiconductor laser
To build a p-n junction laser, we need to form a junction in a highly doped,
direct semiconductor (GaAs, for example), construct a resonant cavity in
the proper geometrical relationship to the junction, and make contact to
the junction in a mounting which allows for efficient heat transfer. The first
lasers were built as shown in Fig. 8–22. Beginning with a degenerate n-type
sample, a p region is formed on one side, for example by diffusing Zn into the
n-type GaAs. Since Zn is in column II of the periodic table and is introduced
substitutionally on Ga sites, it serves as an acceptor in GaAs; therefore, the
heavily doped Zn diffused layer forms a p+ region (Fig. 8–22b).At this point
we have a large-area planar p-n junction. Next, grooves are cut or etched

along the length of the sample as in Fig. 8–22c, leaving a series of long p
regions isolated from each other. These p-n junctions can be cut or broken
apart (Fig. 8–22d) and then cleaved into devices of the desired length.
At this point in the fabrication process, the very important requirements of a resonant cavity must be considered. It is necessary that the front
and back faces (Fig. 8–22e) be flat and parallel. This can be accomplished
by cleaving. If the sample has been oriented so that the long junctions of
Fig. 8–22d are perpendicular to a crystal plane of the material, it is possible
to cleave the sample along this plane into laser devices, letting the crystal
structure itself provide the parallel faces. The device is then mounted on
a suitable header, and contact is made to the p region. Various techniques
are used to provide adequate heat sinking of the device for large forward
current levels.
8.4.4 heterojunction lasers
The device described above was the first type used in the early development
of semiconductor lasers. Since the device contains only one junction in a
single type of material, it is referred to as a homojunction laser. To obtain
more efficient lasers, and particularly to build lasers that operate at room
temperature, it is necessary to use multiple layers in the laser structure. Such
devices, called heterojunction lasers, can be made to operate continuously at
room temperature to satisfy the requirements of optical communications. An
example of a heterojunction laser is shown in Fig. 8–23. In this structure the
injected carriers are confined to a narrow region so that population inversion
can be built up at lower current levels. The result is a lowering of the threshold current at which laser action begins. Carrier confinement is obtained in
this single-heterojunction laser by the layer of AlGaAs grown epitaxially on
the GaAs.
In GaAs the laser action occurs primarily on the p side of the junction
due to a higher efficiency for electron injection than for hole injection. In a
normal p-n junction the injected electrons diffuse into the p material such

that population inversion occurs for only part of the electron distribution
near the junction. However, if the p material is narrow and terminated in a
barrier, the injected electrons can be confined near the junction. In Fig. 8–23a,
an epitaxial layer of p-type AlGaAs (Eg ≃ 2eV) is grown on top of the thin
p-type GaAs region. The wider band gap of AlGaAs effectively terminates
the p-type GaAs layer, since injected electrons do not surmount the barrier
at the GaAs–AlGaAs heterojunction (Fig. 8–23b). As a result of the confinement of injected electrons, laser action begins at a substantially lower
current than for simple p-n junctions. In addition to the effects of carrier
confinement, the change of refractive index at the heterojunction provides
a waveguide effect for optical confinement of the photons.
A further improvement can be obtained by sandwiching the
active GaAs layer between two AlGaAs layers (Fig. 8–24). This doubleheterojunction structure further confines injected carriers to the active
region, and the change in refractive index at the GaAs–AlGaAs boundaries
helps to confine the generated light waves. In the double-heterojunction
laser shown in Fig. 8–24b the injected current is restricted to a narrow stripe
along the lasing direction, to reduce the total current required to drive the
device. This type of laser was a major step forward in the development of
lasers for fiber-optic communications.
separate confinement and Graded index channels. One of the disadvantages
of the double-heterostructure laser shown in Fig. 8–24 is the fact that the
carrier confinement and the optical waveguiding both depend on the same
heterojunctions. It is much better to optimize these two functions by using
a narrow confinement region for keeping the carriers in a region of high
recombination, and a somewhat wider optical waveguide region. In Fig.8–25a
we show a separate confinement laser in which the width of the optical

waveguiding region (w) is optimized by using the refractive index step at a
separate heterojunction from that used to confine the carriers. For example,
in the GaAs-Al
xGa1 - xAs system the optical confinement (waveguiding)
occurs at a boundary with much larger composition x (and therefore
smaller refractive index) than is the case for the carrier confinement
barrier. By grading the composition of the AlGaAs it is possible to obtain
even better waveguiding. For example, in Fig. 8–25b a parabolic grading

vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (vcsels). There are advantages to laser
structures in which light is emitted normal to the surface, including ease of
device testing on the wafer before packaging. An interesting approach is the
VCSEL, in which the cavity mirrors are replaced by DBRs, which use many
partial reflectors spaced to reflect light constructively. DBRs can be grown
by MBE or OMVPE. In Fig. 8–26 the bottom DBR mirror of a VCSEL
is composed of many alternating layers of AlAs and GaAs with thickness
one-quarter of a wavelength in each material. The top mirror is composed of
deposited dielectric layers (alternating ZnSe and MgF). Current is funneled
into the active region from the top contact by using an oxide layer achieved
by laterally oxidizing an AlGaAs layer to form an aluminum oxide. The
active region of the laser employs InGaAs-GaAs quantum wells, and the
GaAs cavity between the two DBRs is one wavelength long. The VCSEL
can be made with much shorter cavity length than other structures, and as a
result of Eq. (8–16) the laser modes are widely separated in wavelength. Thus
single-mode laser operation is more easily achieved with the VCSEL. Lasing
can be achieved at very low current (6 50 oA) with this device.
8.4.5 materials for semiconductor lasers
We have discussed the properties of the junction laser largely in terms of
GaAs and AlGaAs. However, as discussed in Section 8.2.2, the InGaAsP>InP
system is particularly well suited for the type of lasers used in fiber-optic
communication systems. Lattice-matching (Section 1.4.1) is important in creating heterostructures by epitaxial growth. The fact that the AlGaAs band

gap can be varied by choice of composition on the column III sublattice
allows the formation of barriers and confining layers such as those shown
in Section 8.4.4. The quaternary alloy InGaAsP is particularly versatile in
the fabrication of laser diodes, allowing considerable choice of wavelength
and flexibility in lattice-matching. By choice of composition, lasers can be
made in the infrared range 1.3-1.55 mm required for fiber optics. Since four
components can be varied in choosing an alloy composition, InGaAsP allows
simultaneous choice of energy gap (and therefore emission wavelength)
and lattice constant (for lattice-matched growth on convenient substrates).
In many applications, however, other wavelength ranges are required for
laser output. For example, the use of lasers in pollution diagnostics requires
wavelengths farther in the infrared than are available from InGaAsP and
AlGaAs. In this application the ternary alloy PbSnTe provides laser output wavelengths from about 7 om to more than 30 om at low temperatures,
depending on the material composition. For intermediate wavelengths, the
InGaSb system can be used.
Materials chosen for the fabrication of semiconductor lasers must
be efficient light emitters and also be amenable to the formation of
p-n junctions and in most cases the formation of heterojunction barriers. These requirements eliminate some materials from practical use in
laser diodes. For example, semiconductors with indirect band gaps are not
sufficiently efficient light emitters for practical laser fabrication. The II–VI
compounds, on the other hand, are generally very efficient at emitting light
but junctions are difficult to form. By modern crystal growth techniques
such as MBE and MOVPE it is possible to grow junctions in ZnS, ZnSe,
ZnTe, and alloys of these materials, using N as the acceptor. Lasers can be
made in these materials which emit in the green and blue-green regions
of the spectrum.
In recent years much progress has been made in the growth of large
band gap semiconductors using GaN, and its alloys with InN and AlN. The
InAlGaN system has direct band gaps over the entire alloy composition
range, and hence offers very efficient light emission. Band gaps range from
about 2 eV for InN to 3.4 eV for GaN and 5 eV for AlN. This covers the
wavelength range from about 620 nm to about 248 nm, which is from blue
to UV. The resurgence of interest in this field was triggered by the work of
Nakamura at Nichia Corporation in Japan who demonstrated very highefficiency blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) in GaN.
Two of the problems that had stymied progress in this field since pioneering work by Pankove in the 1970s was the absence of a suitable substrate having sufficient lattice match with GaN, and the inability to achieve
p-type doping in this semiconductor. GaN bulk crystals cannot be grown
easily because of the high vapor pressure of the nitrogen-bearing precursor (generally ammonia). This requires growth at high temperature and
pressure. This precludes using bulk GaN wafers as substrates for epitaxial
growth. However, epitaxial layers can be grown on other substrates with
reasonable success, in spite of the lattice mismatch.464 Chapter 8
GaN exists in the cubic zinc blende form (which is the preferred structure) as well as the hexagonal wurtzite form. It was demonstrated recently
that cubic GaN could be grown heteroepitaxially on sapphire, even though
it is not lattice-matched to GaN. In fact, sapphire does not even have a cubic
crystal structure—it is hexagonal.The lattice constant of GaN is about 4.5 Å,
while that of sapphire is 4.8 Å, which is a huge lattice mismatch. Contrary
to what would normally be expected, however, high-quality epitaxial GaN
films can be grown on sapphire by MOCVD using ammonia and tri-methyl
gallium as the precursors. One possible reason for the high quality of the
films, as evidenced by blue LEDs and short wavelength lasers fabricated in
these nitrides, is that these large-band-gap semiconductors have very high
chemical bond strengths. As discussed in Section 8.2.1, the addition of In to
GaN results in lower bandgap In-rich regions which provide sites for radiative recombination, minimizing the loss of carriers at dislocations. Another
breakthrough required in the nitrides was the ability to achieve high p-type
doping so that p-n junctions could be formed. It has been demonstrated that
Mg (which is a column II element) doping of MOCVD films, followed by
high temperature annealing can be used to achieve high acceptor concentrations in these systems.
Short wavelength emitters such as UV>blue semiconductor lasers are
important for storage applications such as digital versatile discs (DVDs),
which are higher density versions of compact discs (CDs). The storage density
on these discs is inversely proportional to the square of the laser wavelength
that is used to read the information. Thus reducing the laser wavelength
by a factor of two leads to a four-fold increase of storage density. Such an
increased storage capacity opens up entirely new applications for DVDs that
were not possible previously with conventional CDs, for example, the storage
of full-length movies. A recent example of success in this rapidly progressing
field is a 417-nm semiconductor laser made with InGaN multi–quantum-well
heterostructures.
8.4.6 Quantum cascade lasers
The lasers described above are bipolar devices involving interband transitions. Electrons in the conduction band recombine with holes in the valence
band, and photons are emitted at an energy determined by the bandgap. This
limits laser operation to direct bandgap materials for reasons discussed in
Chapter 4.
The quantum cascade laser (QCL), on the other hand, involves unipolar operation based on inter-subband transitions in a series of coupled
quantum wells, separated by superlattices (Fig. 8–27). As discussed in
Chapter 1 and 3, quantum wells and superlattices are made of semiconductor heterostructures with layer thicknesses comparable to or smaller
than the deBroglie wavelengths of the electrons.
In quantum wells, one gets confinement in one direction, but plane
wave states in the other two directions. This leads to sub-band levels shownOptoelectronic Devices 465
in Fig. 8–27. By carefully designing the quantum well structure in a QCL,
one can design a three-state system (Fig. 8–27). By biasing the QCL, carriers are injected from the left into state 3, creating a population inversion
between states 3 and 2. There is a relatively thick tunnel barrier between
states 3 and 2 in order to allow the population inversion. However, the barrier
must be narrow enough to allow overlap of the wavefunctions in states 3 and 2,
and allow transitions between these levels and allow lasing. Photons in the
QCL are emitted upon transition to state 2. Carriers in state 2 are closely
coupled by a thin tunnel barrier to state 1, and are immediately removed
to this state, so that the population inversion between states 3 and 2 can be
maintained. Carriers in state 1 are subsequently injected to state 3 in the
next stage of the QCL through the digitally graded superlattice (SL), and
the whole process is repeated, until the current is extracted on the right-hand
side of the QCL. It is clear that the number of photons emitted per electron
injected depends on the number of these energy staircases, 1, 2, 3.
Since the QCL involves electronic transitions entirely within conduction inter-subband quantum well states, it does not require a direct bandgap
semiconductor, and the photon energy is not related to the bandgaps of
the semiconductors used in the superlattice. Instead, the photon energies
are much lower, and are determined by the quantum well design and the
sub-band energies. This enables one to generate THz radiation in a very
important portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between micro>sub@mm
waves and far infrared (300 GHz – 3 THz) where there is a paucity of good
sources, leading to the so-called THz gap. This frequency range is very useful,
for example, for biomolecule and chemical species detection because many
molecular transitions are in this frequency range.

summaRy 8.1 The emission and absorption of light by semiconductors gives rise to useful
optoelectronic devices. Emission typically occurs in direct band gap materials. Indirect semiconductors are less optically efficient because they require
the involvement of both photons (which carry energy, but little momentum)
and phonons (which carry momentum, but little energy).
8.2 In some optoelectronic devices, electron–hole pairs (EHPs) are generated by
the absorption of light. These carriers can be collected as electrical energy in
solar cells or photodetectors. Generated EHPs add to the thermally generated
reverse current in diodes (Eq. 8–2), from which one can obtain the open-circuit
voltage or short-circuit current in solar cells, a potential renewable source of
energy.
8.3 In photodetectors, there is a trade-off between speed (which requires a short
absorption region for a short transit time) and sensitivity (which requires long
absorption regions). Clever structures to get both include waveguide photodetectors. One can achieve gain by using APDs, in which impact ionization
can increase the number of EHPs generated for a certain number of absorbed
photons. However, this can be at the expense of increased impact ionization
noise in photodiodes.
8.4 Photodiodes, in conjunction with light emitters, are used with optical fibers for
fiber-optic communication, which is the backbone of the Internet and worldwide communication today. Optical fibers are waveguides that work on the
basis of the total internal reflection of light from a low-refractive-index outer
layer to a high-refractive-index medium (glass).
8.5 Semiconductors can be used not only to detect photons, but also to emit photons by the recombination of EHPs in direct band gap semiconductors. Light
emitters can be noncoherent, such as LEDs, or coherent, such as lasers. The
color of light depends on the semiconductor, because the photon frequency is
proportional to the band gap (Planck relationship).
8.6 Lasers are more difficult to make than LEDs, because they require not just
EHPs, but population inversion (i.e., more carriers in the higher energy levels
than in the lower ones). This enables stimulated emission of phase-coherent
radiation (governed by the Einstein B coefficient) to dominate over phaseincoherent spontaneous radiation (determined by the Einstein A coefficient).
Lasers also require an optical cavity to allow the photon field to build up. Light
can come out from the side of the cavity, as in edge-emitting lasers, or from the
top surface, as in vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). Doubleheterostructure lasers are useful because they allow both carrier and photon
confinement.
8.1 For the p-i-n photodiode of Fig. 8–7, (a) explain why this detector does not
have gain; (b) explain how making the device more sensitive to low light
levels degrades its speed; (c) if this device is to be used to detect light with
l = 0.6 om, what material would you use and what substrate would you grow
it on?
PROblemsOptoelectronic Devices 467
8.2 We make a quantum well by sandwiching a 60 Å layer of GaAs (Eg = 1.43 eV)
between AlAs with a bandgap of 2.18 eV. We can assume two-thirds of the
bandgap difference appear as conduction band discontinuity, and the rest
in the valence band. The electron and hole effective masses in GaAs are
0.067 m0 and 0.5 m0, respectively. If we make an LED out of this heterostructure, what is the lowest energy photon that can be emitted from this GaAs
layer? If we make a photodetector out of this, what is the longest wavelength
that can be detected? You can assume the infinite potential well approximation
for this calculation. How many confined states can you have in the conduction
and valence bands in the GaAs layer? Qualitatively sketch the electron and
hole probability density functions for these states. How far from the heterointerfaces is the hole most likely to be in the second excited state?
8.3 For a Si solar cell, the dark saturation current is 2 μA and the short circuit current is 150 mA. When it is optically illuminated, the optically generated current
is 0.1 mA. Find the corresponding voltage at current of 100 mA.
8.4 For a Si photoconductor of length 5 om, doped n-type at 1015 cm-3, calculate
the change in current density when we shine light on the photoconductor
under the following circumstances: We create 1020 electron@hole pairs>cm3@s
and carrier–recombination lifetimes, t = 0.1 os. The applied voltage is 2.5 V
across the photoconductor’s length. How about if we increase the voltage to
2500 V? The electron and hole mobilities are 1500 cm2>V@s and 500 cm2>V@s,
respectively, in the ohmic region for electric fields below 104 V>cm. For higher
fields, electrons and holes have a saturation velocity of 107 cm>s.

the short-circuit current is 200 mA. Plot the I–V curve for the cell as in Fig. 8–6.

8.6 What is the main limiting factor in increasing the efficiency of a solar cell?
8.7 A major problem with solar cells is internal resistance, generally in the thin

light of l = 1 om?

1018 EHP>cm3@s within Lp = Ln = 2 mm of the junction. If the depletion width
is 1 om, calculate the short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage for this
cell.468 Chapter 8
8.10 The maximum power delivered by a solar cell can be found by maximizing the
I–V product.
(a) Show that maximizing the power leads to the expression
a1 + kT q Vmpb eqVmp>kT = 1 + IIth sc
where V
mp is the voltage for maximum power, Isc is the magnitude of the shortcircuit current, and Ith is the thermally induced reverse saturation current.
(b) Write this equation in the form ln x = C - x for the case Isc ⪢ Ith, and
V
mp ⪢ kT>q.
(c) Assume a Si solar cell with a dark saturation current Ith of 1.5 nA is illuminated such that the short-circuit current is I
sc = 100 mA. Use a graphical
solution to obtain the voltage Vmp at maximum delivered power.
(d) What is the maximum power output of the cell at this illumination?

Given the cell parameters of Prob. 8.10, plot the I–V curve as in Fig. 8–6 and
draw the maximum power rectangle. Remember that I is a negative number
but is plotted positive as Ir in the figure. Ith and Isc are positive magnitudes in
the equation.
8.12 Solar cells are severely degraded by unwanted series resistance. For the cell
described in Prob. 8.7, include a series resistance R, which reduces the cell voltage by the amount IR. Calculate and plot the fill factor for a series resistance
R from 0 to 5Ω, and comment on the effect of R on cell efficiency.
8.13 During the absorption spectra measurement of an unknown semiconductor
material, the peak of the spectra appears around 364 nm. What is the band gap
of the device and what material is this? If the majority carrier in that material
will be able to move with 5 * 105 cm/sec velocity, what will be the carrier mass
for that material?
8.14 A semiconductor material of band gap 1.2 eV is used to make a device. At what
wavelength it will emit radiation? Is the emitted radiation in the optical range?
From these, can you predict the band gap nature of the semiconductor material
under observation?
8.15 The degenerate occupation of bands shown in Fig. 8–19 helps maintain the
laser requirement that emission must overcome absorption. Explain how the
degeneracy prevents band-to-band absorption at the emission wavelength.
8.16 Assume that the system described by Eq. (8–7) is in thermal equilibrium at an
extremely high temperature such that the energy density r(n12) is essentially

becomes

Suppose for such a device acceptor concentration is 1018/cm3, diffusion coefficient
for holes is 10.36 cm2/sec, mobility for holes is 400 cm2/V-sec, carrier lifetime =
10 ns, and applied bias is 0.7 V. Due to uniform illumination, 1020/cm3 EHP is generated. Now calculate the excess hole distribution for this long diode at a distance
of twice the diffusion length from the junction at the n side.

Integrated Circuits
Just as the transistor revolutionized electronics by offering more flexibility, convenience, and reliability than the vacuum tube, the integrated circuit
enables new applications for electronics that were not possible with discrete
devices. Integration allows complex circuits consisting of millions of transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors to be included in a chip of semiconductor. This means that sophisticated circuitry can be miniaturized for use in
space vehicles, in large-scale computers, and in other applications where a
large collection of discrete components would be impractical. In addition to
offering the advantages of miniaturization, the simultaneous fabrication of
many ICs on a single Si wafer greatly reduces the cost and increases the reliability of each of the finished circuits. Certainly discrete components have
played an important role in the development of electronic circuits; however,
most circuits are now fabricated on the Si chip rather than with a collection
of individual components. Therefore, the traditional distinctions between the
roles of circuit and system designers do not apply to IC development.
In this chapter we shall discuss various types of ICs and the fabrication
steps used in their production. We shall investigate techniques for building
large numbers of transistors, capacitors, and resistors on a single chip of Si,
as well as the interconnection, contacting, and packaging of these circuits in
usable form. All the processing techniques discussed here are very basic and
general. There would be no purpose in attempting a comprehensive review
of all the subtleties of device fabrication in a book of this type. In fact, the
only way to keep up with such an expanding field is to study the current
literature. Many good reviews are suggested in the reading list at the end of
this chapter; more important, current issues of those periodicals cited can be

In this section we provide an overview of the nature of integrated circuits
and the motivation for using them. It is important to realize the reasons,
both technical and economic, for the dramatic rise of ICs to their present
role in electronics. We shall discuss several main types of ICs and point out
some of the applications of each. More specific fabrication techniques will
be presented in later sections.
9.1.1 Advantages of Integration
It might appear that building complicated circuits, involving many interconnected components on a single Si substrate, would be risky both technically
and economically. In fact, however, modern techniques allow this to be done
reliably and relatively inexpensively; in most cases an entire circuit on a Si
chip can be produced much more inexpensively and with greater reliability
than a similar circuit built up from individual components. The basic reason
is that many identical circuits can be built simultaneously on a single Si wafer
(Fig. 9–1); this process is called batch fabrication. Although the processing
steps for the wafer are complex and expensive, the large number of resulting
integrated circuits makes the ultimate cost of each fairly low. Furthermore,
the processing steps are essentially the same for a circuit containing millions
of transistors as for a simpler circuit. This drives the IC industry to build
increasingly complex circuits and systems on each chip, and use larger Si
wafers (e.g., 12-inch diameter). As a result, the number of components in
each circuit increases without a proportional increase in the ultimate cost
of the system. The implications of this principle are tremendous for circuit
designers; it greatly increases the flexibility of design criteria. Unlike circuits
with individual transistors and other components wired together or placed
on a circuit board, ICs allow many “extra” components to be included without greatly raising the cost of the final product. Reliability is also improved
since all devices and interconnections are made on a single rigid substrate,
greatly minimizing failures due to the soldered interconnections of discrete
component circuits.
The advantages of ICs in terms of miniaturization are obvious. Since
many circuit functions can be packed into a small space, complex electronic
equipment can be employed in many applications where weight and space
are critical, such as in aircraft or space vehicles. In large-scale computers
it is now possible not only to reduce the size of the overall unit but also
to facilitate maintenance by allowing for the replacement of entire circuits
quickly and easily. Applications of ICs are pervasive in such consumer
products as watches, calculators, automobiles, telephones, television, and
consulted for up-to-date information regarding IC technology. Having the
background of this chapter, one should be able to read the current literature
and thereby keep abreast of the present trends in this very important field
of electronics.

appliances. Miniaturization and the cost reduction provided by ICs mean
that we all have increasingly more sophisticated electronics at our disposal.
Some of the most important advantages of miniaturization pertain to
response time and the speed of signal transfer between circuits. For example,
in high-frequency circuits it is necessary to keep the separation of various
components small to reduce time delay of signals. Similarly, in very highspeed computers it is important that the various logic and information storage circuits be placed close together. Since electrical signals are ultimately
limited by the speed of light (about 1 ft>ns), physical separation of the circuits can be an important limitation. As we shall see in Section 9.5, large-scale
integration (LSI) of many circuits on a Si chip has led to major reductions
in computer size, thereby tremendously increasing speed and function density. In addition to decreasing the signal transfer time, integration can reduce
parasitic capacitance and inductance between circuits. Reduction of these
parasitics can provide significant improvement in the operating speed of
the system.
We have discussed several advantages of reducing the size of each unit
in the batch fabrication process, such as miniaturization, high-frequency and
switching speed improvements, and cost reduction due to the large number

of circuits fabricated on a single wafer. Another important advantage has to
do with the percentage of usable devices (often called the yield) which results
from batch fabrication. Faulty devices usually occur because of some defect
in the Si wafer or in the fabrication steps. Defects in the Si can occur because
of lattice imperfections and strains introduced in the crystal growth, cutting,
and handling of the wafers. Usually such defects are extremely small, but
their presence can ruin devices built on or around them. Reducing the size
of each device greatly increases the chance for a given device to be free of
such defects. The same is true for fabrication defects, such as the presence of
a dust particle on a photolithographic mask. For example, a lattice defect
or dust particle 1 2 om in diameter can easily ruin a circuit which includes
the damaged area. If a fairly large circuit is built around the defect it will
be faulty; however, if the device size is reduced so that four circuits occupy
the same area on the wafer, chances are good that only the one containing
the defect will be faulty and the other three will be good. Therefore, the percentage yield of usable circuits increases over a certain range of decreasing
chip area. There is an optimum area for each circuit, above which defects are
needlessly included and below which the elements are spaced too closely for
reliable fabrication.
9.1.2 types of Integrated Circuits
There are several ways of categorizing ICs as to their use and method of
fabrication. The most common categories are linear or digital, according to
application, and monolithic or hybrid, according to fabrication.
A linear IC is an IC that performs amplification or other essentially
linear operations on signals. Examples of linear circuits are simple amplifiers, operational amplifiers, and analog communications circuits. Digital
circuits involve logic and memory, for applications in computers, calculators,
microprocessors, and the like. By far the greatest volume of ICs has been in
the digital field, since large numbers of such circuits are required. Because
digital circuits generally require only the “on–off” operation of transistors,
the design requirements for integrated digital circuits are often less stringent
than for linear circuits. Although transistors can be fabricated as easily in an
integrated form as in a discrete form, passive elements (resistors and capacitors) are usually more difficult to produce to close tolerances in ICs.
Integrated circuits that are included entirely on a single chip of semiconductor (usually Si) are called monolithic circuits (Fig. 9–1). The word
monolithic literally means “one stone” and implies that the entire circuit
is contained in a single piece of semiconductor. Any additions to the semiconductor sample, such as insulating layers and metallization patterns, are
intimately bonded to the surface of the chip. A hybrid circuit may contain
one or more monolithic circuits or individual transistors bonded to an insulating substrate with resistors, capacitors, or other circuit elements, together
with appropriate interconnections. Monolithic circuits have the advantage
that all of their components are contained in a single rigid structure that can476 Chapter 9
be batch fabricated; that is, hundreds of identical circuits can be built simultaneously on a Si wafer. On the other hand, hybrid circuits offer excellent
isolation between components and allow the use of more precise resistors
and capacitors. Furthermore, hybrid circuits are often less expensive to build
in small numbers.

The IC was invented in February 1959 by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments. The
planar version of the IC was developed independently by Robert Noyce at
Fairchild in July 1959. Since then, the evolution of this technology has been
extremely fast paced. One way to gauge the progress of the field is to look
at the complexity of ICs as a function of time. Fig. 9–2 shows the number of
transistors used in MOS microprocessor IC chips as a function of time. It is
amazing that on this semilog plot, where we have plotted the log of the component count as a function of time, we get a straight line over four decades,
indicating that there has been an exponential growth in the complexity of
chips. The component count has roughly doubled every 18 months, as was
noted early on by Gordon Moore of Intel corporation. This regular doubling
has become known as Moore’s law.
The history of ICs can be described in terms of different eras, depending on the component count. Small-scale integration refers to the integration
of 1-102 devices, medium-scale integration to the integration of 102-103
devices, LSI to the integration of 103-105 devices, very large-scale integration
to the integration of 105-106 devices, and now ultra large-scale integration
(ULSI) to the integration of 106-109 devices. Of course, these boundaries
are somewhat fuzzy. The next generation has been dubbed gigascale integration. Wags have suggested that after that we will have RLSI, or “ridiculously
large-scale integration.”
The main factor that has enabled this increase in complexity is the
ability to shrink or scale devices. Typical dimensions or feature sizes of stateof-the-art dynamic random-access memories (DRAMs) at different times are
also shown as a semilog plot in Fig. 9–3. Once again, we see a straight line,
reflecting an exponential decrease in the typical feature sizes with time over
four decades. Clearly, one can pack a larger number of components with
greater functionality on an IC if they are smaller. As discussed in Section
6.5.9, scaling also has other advantages in terms of faster ICs which consume
less power.
While scaling represents an opportunity, it also presents tremendous
technological challenges. The most notable among these challenges lie in
lithography and etching, as discussed in Section 5.1. However, since scaling
of horizontal dimensions also requires scaling of vertical geometries, as discussed in Section 6.5.9, there are also tremendous challenges in terms of doping, gate dielectrics, and metallization. In addition, small features and large
chips require device fabrication in extremely clean environments. Particles
that may not have caused yield problems in a 1@om IC technology can have
catastrophic effects for a 22 nm process, which requires purer chemicals,Integrated Circuits 477

cleaner equipment, and more stringent clean rooms. In fact, the levels of
cleanliness required bypassed the best surgical operating rooms early in the
evolution shown in Fig. 9–3. The cleanliness of these facilities is designated
by the class of the clean room. For instance, a Class 1 clean room, which was
state-of-the-art in 2000, has less than 1 particle of size 0.2 om or larger per
cubic foot. There are more of the smaller particles and fewer of the larger
ones. Obviously, the lower the class of a clean room, the better it is. A Class
1 clean room is much cleaner than a Class 100 fabrication facility, or “fab.”
As one might expect, such high levels of cleanliness come with a hefty price
tag: A state-of-the-art fab in 2014 comes equipped with a price tag of about
5–10 billion dollars.
In spite of the costs, the economic payoff for ULSI is tremendous. Just

third millennium. The total annual economic output of all the countries in the

world, or the so-called gross world product (GWP), is about 85 trillion US
dollars. The US gross national product is about 16 trillion dollars, or about a
fifth of the GWP. The worldwide IC industry output is about 350 billion dollars, and that of the entire worldwide electronics industry in which these ICs
participate is about 2 trillion dollars. As a single industry, electronics is one
of the biggest in terms of the dollar amount. It has surpassed, for example,
automobiles (worldwide sales of about 50 million cars annually) and petrochemicals. About 1 billion smart phones are sold annually worldwide.
Perhaps even more dramatic than these raw economic numbers is the
growth rate of these markets. If one were to plot IC sales as a function of
time, one again finds a more-or-less exponential increase in sales with time
over three decades. Of great importance to the consumer, the cost per electronic function has dropped dramatically over the same period. For example,
the cost per bit of semiconductor memory (DRAM) has dropped from about
1 cent>bit in 1970 to about 10-5 cent per bit today, an improvement of five
orders of magnitude in 45 years. There are no parallels in any other industry
for this consistent improvement in functionality with such a lowered cost.
Although ICs started with bipolar processes in the 1960s, they were
gradually supplanted by MOS and then by CMOS devices, for reasons discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. Currently, about 90, of the IC market is MOS
based and about 8, BJT based. Optoelectronic devices based on compound
semiconductors are still a relatively small component of the semiconductor
market (about 4,), but are expected to grow in the future. Of the MOS ICs,
the bulk are digital ICs. Of the entire semiconductor industry, only about 14,
are analog ICs. Semiconductor memories such as DRAMs, SRAMs, and nonvolatile flash memories make up approximately 25% of the market, microprocessors about 25,, and other application-specific ICs (ASICs) about 20,.

Now we shall consider the various elements that make up an integrated
circuit, and some of the steps in their fabrication. The basic elements are
fairly easy to name—transistors, resistors, capacitors, and some form of interconnection. There are some elements in integrated circuits, however, which
do not have simple counterparts in discrete devices. We shall consider one
of these, charge transfer devices, in Section 9.4. Discussion of fabrication
technology is difficult in a book of this type, since device fabrication engineers seem to make changes faster than typesetters do! Since this important
and fascinating field is changing so rapidly, the reader should obtain a basic
understanding of device design and processing from this discussion and then
search out new innovations in the current literature.
9.3.1 CMOs Process Integration
A particularly useful device for digital applications is a combination of
n-channel and p-channel MOS transistors on adjacent regions of the
chip. This complementary MOS (commonly called CMOS) combination is480 Chapter 9
illustrated in the basic inverter circuit of Fig. 9–4a. In this circuit the drains
of the two transistors are connected together and form the output, while
the input terminal is the common connection to the transistor gates. The pchannel device has a negative threshold voltage, and the n-channel transistor
has a positive threshold voltage. Therefore, a zero voltage input (Vin = 0)
gives zero gate voltage for the n-channel device, but the voltage between
the gate and source of the p-channel device is -VDD. Thus the p-channel
device is on, the n-channel device is off, and the full voltage VDD is measured
at Vout (i.e., VDD appears across the nonconducting n-channel transistor).
Alternatively, a positive value of Vin turns the n-channel transistor on, and
the p-channel off. The output voltage measured across the “on” n-channel
device is essentially zero. Thus, the circuit operates as an inverter—with a
binary “1” at the input, the output is in the “0” state, whereas a “0” input
produces a “1” output. The beauty of this circuit is that one of the devices is
turned off for either condition. Since the devices are connected in series, no
drain current flows, except for a small charging current during the switching
process from one state to the other. Since the CMOS inverter uses ultra little
power, it is particularly useful in applications such as electronic watch circuits
that depend on very low power consumption. CMOS is also advantageous
in ultra large-scale integrated circuits (Section 9.5), since even small power

dissipation in each transistor becomes a problem when millions of them are
integrated on a chip.
The device technology for achieving CMOS circuits consists mainly in
arranging for both n- and p-channel devices with similar threshold voltages
on the same chip. To achieve this goal, a diffusion or implantation must be
performed in certain areas to obtain n and p regions for the fabrication of
each type of device. These regions are called tubs, tanks, or wells (Fig. 9–5).
The critical parameter of the tub is its net doping concentration, which must
be closely controlled by ion implantation. With the tub in place, source and
drain implants are performed to make the n-channel and p-channel transistors. Matching of the two transistors is achieved by control of the surface
doping in the tub and by threshold adjustment of both transistors by ion
implantation.
Including bipolar transistors in the basic CMOS technology allows
flexibility in circuit design, particularly for providing drive currents. The
combination of bipolar and CMOS (called BiCMOS) provides circuits with
increased speed.
Attention must be paid in CMOS designs to the fact that combining
n-channel and p-channel devices in proximity can lead to inadvertent (parasitic) bipolar structures. In fact, a p-n-p-n structure can be found in Fig. 9–4b,
which can serve as an inefficient but troublesome thyristor (see Chapter 10).
Under certain biasing conditions the p-n-p part of the structure can supply base current to the n-p-n structure, causing a large current to flow. This
process, called latchup, can be a serious problem in CMOS circuits. Several
methods have been used to eliminate the latchup problem, including using
both n-type and p-type tubs, separated by trench isolation (Fig. 9–6). The use
of two separate tubs (wells) also allows independent control of threshold
voltages in both types of transistor.
We can illustrate most of the common fabrication steps for MOS integrated circuits by studying the flow of a twin-well Self-Aligned siLICIDE
(SALICIDE) CMOS process. This process is particularly important because
most high-performance digital ICs, including microprocessors, memories and
application-specific ICs (ASICs) are made basically in this way. In order to
make enhancement-mode n-channel devices, we need a p-type substrate,
and vice versa. Since CMOS requires both, we must start either with an
n-type or a p-type wafer and then make selected regions of the substrate
have opposite doping by forming wells. For example, Fig. 9–5a shows a lightly
doped p-epitaxial layer on a p+@substrate. We can make n-channel devices in
this layer. By implanting n-wells wherever needed, we can make p-channel
devices also. This is an n-well CMOS process. Alternatively, if we start with
an n-substrate and make p-wells in certain regions, we have a p-well CMOS
process. For optimal device performance, however, it is usually desirable to
separately implant both the n- and the p-well regions, which is called twinwell CMOS. The rationale for this can be appreciated if we keep in mind that
for a state-of-the-art IC, typical doping levels are ∼1018 cm-3 and junction482 Chapter 9

depths are ∼1 om in these wells. The doping levels have to be high enough
to prevent punch-through breakdown due to drain-induced barrier lowering
(DIBL) in the MOSFETs, but low enough to keep the threshold voltages
acceptably small. If we choose to use the p-substrate for n-channel devices
as in Fig. 9–5a, the p-type epitaxial layer must be doped to 1018 cm - 3, and
the implanted n-type layer must be achieved by counter-doping at a level of
∼2 * 1018 cm - 3, resulting in a net n-type doping of ∼1 * 1018 cm - 3, but a
total doping in this region of ∼3 * 1018 cm - 3. Such high levels of total doping are detrimental to carrier transport because they cause excessive ionized
impurity scattering. Hence, for high performance ICs, the starting epitaxial
doping level is generally very low (∼1016 cm - 3). This layer is grown on a heavily doped substrate (∼1019 cm-3), to provide a highly conducting electrical
ground plane. This helps with noise problems in ICs and helps minimize the
problem of latchup by bypassing majority carriers (in this case holes) to the
p+ substrate.
To form the twin wells in a self-aligned fashion, we first grow thermally a “pad” oxide (∼20 nm) on the Si substrate, followed by low-pressure
chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of silicon nitride (∼20 nm). As shown
in Fig. 9–5a, this oxide–nitride stack is covered by photoresist, and a window

is opened for the n-well. Reactive ion etching (RIE) is then used to etch the
oxide–nitride stack. Using the photoresist as an implant mask, we then do
an n-type implant using phosphorus. Phosphorus is preferred to As for this
purpose because P is lighter and has a higher projected range; also, P diffuses
faster. This fast diffusion is needed to drive the dopants fairly deep into the
substrate to form the n-well. After the implant, the photoresist is removed,
and the patterned wafer is subjected to wet oxidation to grow a “tank” oxide
(∼200 nm). Note in Fig. 9–5b that the tank oxidation process consumes Si
from the substrate, and the resulting oxide swells up. In fact, for every micron
of thermally grown oxide, the oxidation consumes 0.44 om of Si, resulting in
a 2.2-fold volume expansion.The oxide does not grow in the regions that are
protected by silicon nitride, because nitride blocks the diffusion of oxygen
and water molecules (and thereby prevents oxidation of the Si substrate).
The pad oxide that is used under the nitride has two roles: It minimizes the
thermal-expansion mismatch and concomitant stress between silicon nitride
and the substrate; it also prevents chemical bonding of the silicon nitride to
the silicon substrate.
Using the tank oxide as a self-aligned implant mask (i.e., without actually having to do a separate photolithographic step), one does a p-type well
implant using boron (B; Fig. 9–5b).The tank oxide must thus be much thicker
than the projected range of the B. The concept of self-alignment is very
important and is a recurring theme in IC processing. It is simpler and cheaper
to use self-alignment than a separate lithographic step. It also allows a tighter
packing density of the twin wells, because it is not required to account for
lithographic misalignment during layout. The P and the B are then diffused
into the substrate to a well depth of typically a micron by a drive-in diffusion
at very high temperatures (∼1000°C) for several hours. After this diffusion,
the silicon nitride–oxide stack and the tank oxide are etched away. Since
the tank oxidation consumes Si from the substrate, etching it off leads to a
step in the Si substrate delineating the n-well and p-well regions. The step is
important in terms of the alignment of subsequent reticles and is shown in
an exaggerated fashion in Fig. 9–5c. The step, however, is disadvantageous
from the depth-of-focus point of view during lithography. So, instead of a
self-aligned twin-well process as just described, one often uses two separate
lithography steps for the two well implants. This approach leads to a more
planar structure, but a slightly larger well geometry because the wells are
not self-aligned. There are many other variations of CMOS processes used,
depending on the application.
Next, we form the isolation regions or the field transistors that guarantee that there will be no electrical cross talk between adjacent transistors,
unless they are intentionally interconnected (Fig. 9–5c). This is achieved by
ensuring that the threshold voltage of any parasitic transistor that may form
in the isolation regions is much higher than the power supply voltage on the
chip, so that the parasitic channel can never turn on under operating conditions. From the threshold voltage expression [Eq. (6–38)], we notice that
VT can be raised by increasing substrate doping and increasing gate oxideIntegrated Circuits 485
thickness. However, a problem with that approach is the subthreshold slope
S [Eq. (6–66)], which degrades with increasing substrate doping and gate
oxide thickness. One needs to optimize both VT and S such that the off-state
leakage current in the field between transistors is sufficiently low at zero
gate bias.
A stack of silicon dioxide–silicon nitride is photolithographically patterned as in Fig. 9–5c and subjected to RIE.A boron “channel stop” implant
between the twin wells increases the acceptor doping and thus increases the
threshold voltage in the p-well between the n-channel transistors (the field
threshold). However, B will compensate the donor doping on the n-well side,
and thus reduce the threshold in the n-well between p-channel devices. The
B channel stop dose must thus be optimized to have acceptably high field
thresholds in both types of wells.
After the channel stop implant, the photoresist is removed and the
wafer with the patterned nitride–oxide stack shown in Fig. 9–5c (without
photoresist) is subjected to wet oxidation to selectively grow a field oxide
∼300 nm thick. The nitride layer blocks oxidation of the Si substrate in the
regions where we plan to make the transistors. This procedure, where Si is
oxidized to form SiO2 in regions not protected by nitride, is called LOCal
Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) (Section 6.4.1). In this case, LOCOS provides
electrical isolation between the two transistors, as shown in Fig. 9–5d.
The volume expansion of 2.2 * upon oxidation is an important issue
because the selective oxidation occurs in narrow, confined regions. The
compressive stress, if excessive, can cause dislocation defects in the substrate. Another issue is the lateral oxidation near the nitride mask edges,
which causes the nitride mask to lift up near the edges, forming what is
known as a bird’s beak and causing a lateral moat encroachment of ∼0.2 mm
into each active region, thereby wasting precious Si real estate. There have
been various modified LOCOS and other isolation schemes proposed to
minimize this lateral encroachment. A notable example is Shallow Trench
Isolation (STI) which involves using RIE to etch a shallow (∼1 om) trench
or groove in the Si substrate after the isolation pattern, filling it up completely by deposition of a dielectric layer of SiO2 and polysilicon by LPCVD,
and then using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to planarize the structure (Fig. 9–6). This consumes less Si real estate compared with LOCOS,
but gives superior isolation because the sharp corners at the bottom of the
trench give rise to potential barriers that block leakage currents (the corner
effect).
The pad oxide between the nitride and the Si surface minimizes the
stress due to the nitride, and prevents bonding of the nitride to the Si, as
mentioned above. Any residual nitride on the Si would retard subsequent
gate oxide formation, leading to weak spots in the gate region of the
MOSFETs. This problem is known as the white ribbon effect or the Kooi
effect, after the Dutch scientist who first identified it. The pad oxide mitigates this problem, but does not solve it completely. Therefore, very often a
“sacrificial” or “dummy” oxide is grown to consume a layer of Si containing486 Chapter 9
any residual nitride, and this oxide is wet etched prior to the growth of the
actual gate oxide.
In many modern CMOS processes, LOCOS has been supplanted by
STI. Here, we use RIE to etch shallow grooves or trenches (∼0.2 om deep)
in the isolation regions. After growing a thin thermal oxide to passivate the
surface, we fill up the trench with LPCVD oxide and grind the surface flat
with CMP. STI has no moat encroachment, unlike LOCOS, and is capable of
superior electrical isolation using less Si real estate.
Next, an ultra-thin (0.3 nm) gate oxide is grown on the substrate. Since
the electrical quality of this oxide and its interface with the Si substrate is of
paramount importance to the operation of the MOSFETs, dry oxidation is
used for this step. This is followed by deposition of a high-k gate dielectric. It
is immediately covered with LPCVD polysilicon or a metal gate electrode
in order to minimize contamination of the gate oxide. The polysilicon gate
layer is doped very heavily (typically n+ using a phosphorus dopant source,
POCl3 in a diffusion furnace) all the way to the polysilicon–oxide interface
in order to make it behave electrically like a metal electrode. Alternatively,
the LPCVD polysilicon film may also be in situ doped during the deposition
itself by flowing in an appropriate dopant gas such as phosphine or diborane. Heavy doping of the gate material is very important, because otherwise
a depletion layer can be formed in the polysilicon gate (the poly depletion
effect). This could result in a depletion capacitance in series with the gate
oxide capacitance, thereby reducing the overall gate capacitance and, therefore, the drive current [see Eq. (6–53)]. The high doping (∼1020 cm-3) in the
polysilicon gate is also important for reducing the resistance of the gate and
its RC time constant. The uniformly high doping in the polysilicon layer is
facilitated by the presence of the grain boundary defects in the film, because
diffusivity of dopants along grain boundaries is many orders of magnitude
higher than in single-crystal Si. If metal gate electrodes such as TiN are used,
these problems go away. Sometimes, a polysilicon gate may be deposited on
a thin metal gate electrode to make a composite structure.
The doped polysilicon layer or metal gate is then patterned to form the
gates, and etched anisotropically by RIE to achieve vertical sidewalls. That
is extremely important because this etched gate is used as a self-aligned
implant mask for the source>drain implants. As mentioned above, selfaligned processes are always desirable in terms of process simplicity and
packing density. It is particularly useful in this case because we thereby guarantee that there will be some overlap of the gate with the source>drain but
minimal overlap. The overlap is determined by the lateral scattering of the
ions and by the lateral diffusion of the dopants during subsequent thermal
processing (such as source>drain implant anneals). If there were no overlap,
the channel would have to be turned on in this region by the gate fringing fields. The resulting potential barrier in the channel would degrade the
device current. On the other hand, if there is too much overlap, it leads to an
overlap capacitance between the source or drain and the gate. This is particularly bothersome near the drain end because it leads to the Miller overlapIntegrated Circuits 487
capacitance which causes undesired capacitive feedback between the output
drain terminal and the input gate terminal (see Section 6.5.8).
Fabrication steps for the n-channel MOSFETs in the p-well are shown
in Fig. 9–7. After the polysilicon gate is etched, we first do a self-aligned
n-type source–drain implant, during which the tank masking level is used
to protect the PMOS devices with a layer of photoresist. The NMOS source
and drain implants are done in two stages. The first implant is a lightly doped
drain (LDD) implant (Fig. 9–7a). This is typically a dose of ∼1013-1014 cm - 2,
corresponding to a concentration of 1018-1019 cm - 3, and an ultra-shallow
junction depth of 50–100 nm. When a MOSFET is operated in the saturation
region, the drain-channel junction is reverse biased, resulting in a very high
electric field in the pinch-off region. As we saw in Section 5.4 for reversebiased p-n junctions, reducing the doping level increases the depletion width
and makes the peak electric field at the junction smaller. As discussed in
Section 6.5.9, electrons traveling from the source to the drain in the channel
can gain kinetic energy and thereby become hot electrons, which create damage. The low doping in the LDD helps reduce hot carrier effects at the drain
end. The shallow junction depths in the LDD are also important for reducing
short channel effects such as DIBL and charge sharing (Sections 6.5.10 and
6.5.11). The penalty that we pay with the use of an LDD region is that the
source-to-drain series resistance goes up, which degrades the drive current.
As the technology is evolving toward lower power supply voltages,
hot carrier effects are becoming less important. This, along with the need
to reduce series resistance, has driven the trend toward increasing doping
in the LDD to levels above 1019 cm-3. In fact, the use of the term LDD then
becomes a bit of a misnomer, and is often replaced by the term source>drain
extension or tip.
After the LDD regions are formed alongside the polysilicon gate, we
implant deeper (∼200 nm) and more heavily doped (1020 cm - 3) source and
drain junctions farther away from the gate edges (Fig. 9–7d). This more
conductive region allows ohmic contacts to the source and drain to be
formed more easily than they could be directly to the LDD regions, and
reduces the source>drain series resistance. This implant is done using a selfaligned scheme by the formation of sidewall oxide spacers. After removing
the photoresist covering the PMOS devices, we deposit conformal LPCVD
oxide (∼100-200 nm thick) using an organic precursor called tetra-ethylortho-silicate (TEOS) over the entire wafer at fairly high temperatures
(∼700°C) (Fig. 9–7b). The term conformal means that the deposited film
has the same thickness everywhere, and follows the topography on the
wafer. This oxide layer is then subjected to RIE, which is anisotropic
(i.e., it etches predominantly in the vertical direction) (Section 5.1.7). If the
RIE step is timed to just etch off the deposited oxide on the flat surfaces, it
leaves oxide sidewall spacers on the edges of the polysilicon gate, as shown
in Fig. 9–7c. This sidewall spacer is used as a self-aligned mask to protect
the LDD regions very near the gate during the heavier, deeper n+ source
and drain implants (Fig. 9–7d).488 Chapter 9

Next, the NMOS devices are masked by photoresist, and a p+ source
and drain implant is done for the PMOSFETs (Fig. 9–8a). It may be noted
that an LDD was not used for the PMOS. This is due to the fact that hot
hole effects are less problematic than hot electron degradation, partly due
to the lower hole mobility and partly due to the higher Si-SiO2 barrier
in the valence band (5 eV) than in the conduction band (3.1 eV). After
the source–drain implants are done, the dopants are activated and the ion
implant damage is healed by a furnace anneal, or more frequently using a
rapid thermal anneal. In this anneal we use the minimum acceptable temperature and time combination (the thermal budget) because it is critically
important to keep the dopant profiles as compact as possible in ultra-small
MOSFETs.
We can now appreciate why most CMOS logic devices are made on
p-type substrates, rather than n-type. The n-channel MOSFETs generate a lot
more substrate current due to hot carrier effects than PMOSFETs. The holes,
thus generated, can more easily flow to ground in a p-type substrate, than
in an n-substrate. Also, it is easier to dope substrates p-type with B during
Czochralski crystal growth than n-type with Sb. Antimony is the preferred
donor, rather than As or P for bulk doping of the Si melt, because Sb evaporates less than the other species.
The use of n+ polysilicon gates for both NMOS and PMOS devices
raises some interesting device issues. Since the Fermi level in the n+ gate
is very close to the Si conduction band, its work function is well suited to
achieving a low VT for NMOS (Φms∼ -1 V), but not for PMOS (Φms∼0 V).
From the VT expression [Eq. (6–38)], we notice that the second and third
terms approach zero as thin-oxide technology evolves because Ci is getting larger. For high drive current we want VT to be in the neighborhood
of ∼0.3 to ∼0.7 V for NMOS (-0.3 to -0.7 V for PMOS). We find from
Eq. (6–38) that the p-well doping can be optimized to achieve the correct
VT for the NMOS transistor, while at the same time being high enough to
prevent punch-through breakdown between source and drain. For the PMOS
transistor, on the other hand, an n-well doping of the order of 1018 cm - 3
prevents punch-through, but the Fermi potential, hF, is so large and negative that the VT is too negative. That forces us to do a separate acceptor
implant to adjust VT for the PMOS devices (Fig. 9–8b). The acceptor dose
is low enough that the p-layer is fully depleted at zero gate bias, leading to
enhancement-mode, rather than depletion-mode, transistors. In CMOS we
try to make the negative VT of the PMOS device about the same value as
the positive VT of the NMOS.
Close examination of the band diagram in the channel of the
PMOSFET along the vertical direction (perpendicular to the gate oxide)
shows that the energy minimum for the holes in the inversion layer is
slightly below (∼100 nm) the oxide–silicon interface, leading to what is
known as buried channel operation for PMOS (Fig. 9–8c). On the other
hand, for NMOS, the electron energy minimum in the inversion layer
occurs right at the oxide–silicon interface, leading to surface channeln+ n+

operation.1 There are good and bad aspects of this buried channel behavior
for PMOS. Since the holes in the inversion layer of the PMOSFET travel
slightly away from the oxide–silicon interface, they do not suffer as much
channel mobility degradation as the electrons in the NMOSFET due to
surface roughness scattering. That is good, because hole mobilities in Si are
generally lower than electron mobilities, which forces us to make PMOS
devices wider than the NMOSFETs to get similar drive currents. However,
buried channel devices have a greater propensity toward DIBL and punchthrough breakdown. Hence, as the size of MOSFETs is reduced, the DIBL
problem becomes worse, and there is a desire to have surface channel operation for both NMOS and PMOS. Thus, there is interest in so-called dual gate
CMOS, where n+ polysilicon gates are used for NMOSFETs and p+ gates
are used for PMOSFETs. Such dual work function gates can be achieved
by depositing the polysilicon undoped and then using the source and drain
implants themselves to also dope the gates appropriately. This approach
exploits the high polysilicon grain boundary diffusivities to degenerately
dope the gates, at the same time having ultra-shallow source and drain junctions to minimize DIBL.
As a historical footnote, it may be added that MOSFETs initially used
Al gates which could not withstand high temperature processing. Hence,
the source and drain regions had to be formed first, either by diffusion or by
implant, and then the Al gate was deposited and patterned. Such nonselfaligned processes suffered from the Miller capacitance mentioned previously. What made self-aligned source and drain regions viable was the use
of polysilicon, which has a sufficiently high melting point to withstand subsequent processing. Recent research on MOSFET technology is going back full
circle to metal gates, but this time using refractory metals such as tungsten
(W). These metals have better conductivity than heavily doped polysilicon,
and a work function that is better suited for CMOS. The Fermi level of W is
near the middle of the Si band gap, which makes the flat band voltage and
the threshold voltage more symmetric and better matched between NMOS
and PMOS, and avoids the buried channel effect.
The next step is to form a metal–silicon alloy or silicide in the
source>drain and gate regions of the MOSFETs in order to reduce the
series resistance (and thereby the RC time constants), and increase the
drive current. This involves depositing a thin layer of a refractory metal
such as Ti over the entire wafer by sputtering, and reacting the Ti with Si
wherever they come in direct contact, by doing a two-step heat treatment in
an N ambient (Fig. 9–9a). A 600°C anneal results in the formation of Ti2Si
(the C49 phase according to metallurgists, which has fairly high resistivity),
1We can qualitatively understand why the acceptor implant in the channel leads to such a buried channel
behavior. Assume for a moment that the acceptor dose was high enough that the p-layer was not depleted
at zero bias. In such a depletion-mode device, a positive gate bias to turn off the device would first deplete
the surface region of holes, still leading to hole conduction deeper in the substrate away from the oxide–Si
interface.492 Chapter 9

followed by an 800°C anneal which converts the Ti2Si to the C54 phase,

than that of the most heavily doped Si. On the other hand, the Ti on top of

Ti or forms TiN because the process is done in an N ambient. The Ti and
TiN can be etched off selectively by using a wet hydrogen peroxide-based
etch, which does not attack the titanium disilicide, thereby electrically isolating the gates from the source>drains. Note that this process results in a
SALICIDE without a separate masking level only on the source>drains
and the polysilicon gate, where the silicide is often termed a polycide. This
results in very high-performance MOSFETs.
Finally, the MOSFETs have to be properly interconnected according
to the circuit layout, using the metallization level. This involves LPCVD
of an oxide dielectric layer doped with B and P, which is known as borophospho-silicate glass (BPSG) on the entire wafer, patterning it by means of
the contact-level reticle and using RIE to open up the contact holes to the
substrate (Fig. 9–9b).The B and P allow the oxide layer to soften and reflow
more readily upon annealing, thereby helping planarize or smooth out the
topography on the wafer. This shaping of the millions of very small contact
holes is critical on a ULSI chip, because otherwise metal deposited on the
surface into the contact holes may not reach completely into the holes, leading to a catastrophic open circuit. In fact, sometimes a CVD tungsten layer is
selectively deposited in the contact holes to form a contact plug before one
proceeds to the next step. Then a suitable metal layer such as Al (alloyed with
∼1 percent Si and ∼4 percent Cu) is sputter deposited over the wafer, patterned using the metal interconnect level, and subjected to metal RIE. The
Si is added to the Al to solve the junction spiking problem, whereby pure Al
can incorporate the solid solubility limit of Si from the shallow source>drain
regions. This would allow the Al to “spike,” or short, through the p-n junction. The Cu is added to enlarge the grain size in the Al interconnect films,
which are polycrystalline, making it harder for the electrons moving during
current flow to nudge the Al atoms along, thereby opening voids (producing open circuits) in the interconnect. This is an example of an electromigration phenomenon. A cross-sectional picture of an LDD MOSFET with
SALICIDE is shown in Fig. 9–9c.
In a modern ULSI chip, the complexity of the device layout generally demands that multiple levels of metallization be used for interconnecting the devices (Fig. 9–10). Hence, after the first metal is deposited,
an intermetal dielectric isolation layer such as SiO2 is deposited by lowtemperature CVD. Low temperatures are very important in this back-end
part of the processing because by now all the active devices are in place and
one cannot allow the dopants to diffuse significantly. Also, the metallization
cannot withstand temperatures higher than ∼500°C. The dielectric isolation
layer must be suitably planarized prior to the deposition of the next layer
of metal, and this is generally done by CMP. Planarization is important
because if metal is deposited on a surface with rough topography and subjected to RIE, there can be residual metal sidewall filaments or “stringers”
at the steps for the same reason one gets sidewall oxide spacers on either
side of the MOSFET gate in Fig. 9–7. These metal stringers can cause short
circuits between adjacent metal lines. Planarization is also important in494 Chapter 9
maintaining good depth of focus during photolithography. After planarization of the isolation layer, one uses photolithography to open up a new set
of contact holes called vias, followed by deposition, patterning and RIE of
the next layer of metal, and so on for multi-level metallization. As mentioned previously, W metal plugs are sometimes selectively deposited to fill
up the via holes prior to the metal deposition, and reduce the likelihood
of an open circuit.
Finally, a protective overcoat is deposited on the IC to prevent contamination and failure of the devices due to the ambient (Fig. 9–10). This
generally involves plasma CVD of silicon nitride, which has the nice attribute
that it blocks the diffusion of water vapor and Na through it. Sodium, as mentioned in Section 6.4.3, causes a mobile ion problem in the gate dielectric of
MOS devices. Sometimes, the protective overcoat is a BPSG layer. After the
overcoat is deposited, openings are etched for the metal bond pads. After the
chips are tested in an automated tester, the known good dies are packaged
and wire bonded, as discussed in Section 9.6.
9.3.2 Integration of Other Circuit elements
One of the most revolutionary developments of integrated circuit technology is the fact that integrated transistors are cheaper to make than are more
mundane elements such as resistors and capacitors. There are, however,
numerous applications calling for diodes, resistors, capacitors, and inductors
in integrated form. In this section we discuss briefly how these circuit elements can be implemented on the chip. We will also discuss a very important
circuit element—the interconnection pattern that ties all of the integrated
devices together in a working system.

diodes. It is simple to build p-n junction diodes in a monolithic circuit. It
is also common practice to use transistors to perform diode functions. Since
many transistors are included in a monolithic circuit, no special diffusion
step is required to fabricate the diode element. There are a number of ways
in which a transistor can be connected as a diode. Perhaps the most common
method is to use the emitter junction as the diode, with the collector and base
shorted. This configuration is essentially the narrow base diode structure,
which has high switching speed with little charge storage (Prob. 5.40). Since
all the transistors can be made simultaneously, the proper connections can
be included in the metallization pattern to convert some of the transistors
into diodes.
resistors. Diffused or implanted resistors can be obtained in monolithic
circuits by using the shallow junctions used in forming the transistor
regions (Fig. 9–11a). For example, during the base implant, a resistor can
be implanted which is made up of a thin p-type layer within one of the ntype islands. Alternatively a p region can be made during the base implant,
and an n-type resistor channel can be included within the resulting p region
during the emitter implant step. In either case, the resistance channel can
be isolated from the rest of the circuit by proper biasing of the surrounding
material. For example, if the resistor is a p-type channel obtained during
the base implant, the surrounding n material can be connected to the
most positive potential in the circuit to provide reverse-bias junction
isolation. The resistance of the channel depends on its length, width, depth
of the implant, and resistivity of the implanted material. Since the depth
and resistivity are determined by the requirements of the base or emitter
implant, the variable parameters are the length and width. Two typical
resistor geometries are shown in Fig. 9–11b. In each case the resistor is long
compared with its width, and a provision is made on each end for making
contact to the metallization pattern.
Design of diffused resistors begins with a quantity called the sheet resistance of the diffused layer. If the average resistivity of a diffused region is t,
the resistance of a given length L is R = tL>wt, where w is the width and t
is the thickness of the layer. Now if we consider one square of the material,

such that L = w, we have the sheet resistance Rs∼t>t in units of ohms per
square. We notice that Rs measured for a given layer is numerically the same
for any size square. This quantity is simple to measure for a thin diffused
layer by a four-point probe technique.2 Therefore, for a given diffusion, the
sheet resistance is generally known with good accuracy. The resistance then
can be calculated from the known value of R
s and the ratio L>w (the aspect
ratio) for the resistor. We can make the width w as small as possible within
the requirements of heat dissipation and photolithographic limitations and
then calculate the required length from w and Rs. Design criteria for diffused
resistors include geometrical factors, such as the presence of high current
density at the inside corner of a sharp turn. In some cases it is necessary to
round corners slightly in a folded or zigzag resistor (Fig. 9–12b) to reduce
this problem.
To reduce the amount of space used for resistors or to obtain larger
resistance values, it is often necessary to obtain surface layers having
larger sheet resistance than is available during the standard base or emitter implants. We can use a different implant, such as the VT adjust implant,
to form shallow regions having very high sheet resistance (∼105 Ω>square).
This procedure can provide a considerable saving of space on the chip. In
integrated FET circuits it is common to replace load resistors with depletionmode transistors, as mentioned in Section 6.5.5.
Capacitors. One of the most important elements of an integrated circuit is
the capacitor. This is particularly true in the case of memory circuits, where
charge is stored in a capacitor for each bit of information. Figure 9–12

2This is a very useful method in which current is introduced into a wafer at one probe and is collected at
another probe, and the voltage is measured by two probes in between. Special formulas are required to
calculate resistivity or sheet resistance from these measurements.Integrated Circuits 497
illustrates a one-transistor DRAM cell, in which the n-channel MOS
transistor provides access to the adjacent MOS capacitor. The top plate
of the capacitor is polysilicon, and the bottom plate is an inversion charge
contacted by an n+ region of the transistor. The terms bit line and word line
refer to the row and column organization of the memory (Section 9.5.2).
One can also make use of the capacitance associated with p-n junctions, as
discussed in Section 5.5.5.
Inductors. Inductors have not been incorporated into ICs in the
past, because it is much harder to integrate inductors than the other
circuit elements. Also, there has not been a great need for integrating
inductors. Recently, that has changed because of the growing need for rf
analog ICs for portable communication electronics. Inductors are very
important for such applications, and can be made with reasonable Q factors
using spiral wound thin metal films on an IC. Such spiral patterns can be
defined by photolithography and etching techniques compatible with IC
processing, or they can be incorporated in a hybrid IC.
Contacts and Interconnections. During the metallization step, the various
regions of each circuit element are contacted and proper interconnection
of the circuit elements is made. Aluminum is commonly used for the top
metallization, since it adheres well to Si and to SiO2 if the temperature
is raised briefly to about 550°C after deposition. Gold is used on GaAs
devices, but the adhesion properties of Au to Si and SiO2 are poor. Gold
also creates deep traps in Si.
As mentioned throughout this chapter, silicide contacts and doped
polysilicon conductors are commonly used in integrated circuits. By opening windows through the oxide layers to these conductors, Al metallization
can be used to contact them and connect them to other parts of the circuit. In
cases where Al is used to contact the Si surface, it is usually necessary to use
Al containing about 1% Si to prevent the metal from incorporating Si from
the layer being contacted, thereby causing “spikes” in the surface. Thin diffusion barriers are also used between the Al and Si layers, to prevent migration
between the two. The refractory silicides mentioned in Section 9.3.1 serve
this purpose.
Increased complexity and packing density in integrated circuits inevitably leads to a need for multilayer metallization. Multiple levels of Cu metallization can be incorporated with interspersing dielectrics. In general, the
metals may all be Al, Cu or they may be different conductors such as polysilicon or refractory metals (depending on the heat each is subjected to in
subsequent processing). Also, the dielectrics may be deposited oxides, borophospho-silicate glass for reflow planarization, nitrides, and so on. The planarization of the surface is extremely important to prevent breaks in the
metallization, which can occur in traversing a step on the surface. Various498 Chapter 9
approaches using reflow glass, polyimide, and other materials to achieve planarization have been used, along with CMP.
The most important challenge in designing interconnects is the RC
time constant, which affects the speed and active power dissipation of the
chip. A very simplistic model of two layers of interconnects with an intermetal dielectric (Figs. 9–13 and 9–14) shows that it can be regarded as a
parallel plate capacitor. Regarding the interconnect as a rectangular resistor,
its resistance is given by
R =
tL

(9–1a)
where R
s is the sheet resistance, and the other symbols are defined in
Fig. 9–14. The capacitance is given by
C = PLw
d (9–1b)
The RC time constant is then
atwt L b aPLw d b = tPtdL2 = RsPdL2 (9–2)
Interestingly, for this simple one-dimensional model, the width of the interconnect w cancels out. Therefore, it does not make sense to use wider conductors for high-speed operation. It is also impractical to do so in terms of
packing density. Of course, in reality we must account for the fringing electric
fields, and therefore account for width dependence. From Eq. (9–2), it is clear
we need as thick a metal layer (within practical limits of deposition times and
etching times) and as low a resistivity as possible. Low resistivities are also

important in minimizing ohmic voltage drops in metal bus lines that carry
power from one end of a chip to the other. Aluminum is very good in this
regard, and thus was a mainstay for Si technology for many years. Aluminum
also has other nice attributes such as good ohmic contacts to both n and
p-type Si, and good adhesion to oxides.
Copper has even lower resistivity (1.7 oΩ@cm) than Al (3 oΩ@cm) and
is about two orders of magnitude less susceptible to electromigration. Hence,
it is an excellent alternative to Al for very high speed ICs (Fig. 9–13).
The process breakthroughs that have made Cu viable for metallization
include new electrodeposition and electroplating techniques because CVD
or sputter deposition is not very practical for Cu. It is also very difficult to use
RIE for Cu because the etch byproducts for Cu are not very volatile. Hence,

instead of RIE, Cu patterning is based on the so-called Damascene process
where grooves are first etched in a dielectric layer, Cu is deposited on it,
and the metal layer is chemically-mechanically polished down, leaving inlaid
metal lines in the oxide grooves. In this method, the metal does not have to
be etched directly using RIE, which is always a difficult process. The name
“damascene” is derived from a metallurgical technique in ancient Turkey
where metal artwork was inlaid into swords and other artifacts using this
type of process. Copper can create traps deep in the band gap of Si; hence,
a suitable barrier layer such as Ti is needed between the Cu layer and the
Si substrate.

are clearly the use of a thick inter-metal dielectric layer (once again within
the limits of practicality in terms of deposition times), and as low a dielectric constant material as possible. Silicon dioxide has a relative dielectric
constant of 3.9. There is active research in low dielectric constant materials
(sometimes referred to as low-k materials). These include organic materials
such as polyimides, or xerogels>aerogels which have air pockets or porosity
purposely built in to minimize the dielectric constant.
In designing the layout of elements for a monolithic circuit, topological problems must be solved to provide efficient interconnection without
crossovers—points at which one conductor crosses another conductor. If
crossovers must be made on the Si surface, they can be accomplished easily
at a resistor. Since the implanted or diffused resistor is covered by SiO2, a
conductor can be deposited crossing the insulated resistor. In cases requiring
crossovers where no resistor is available, a low-value implanted resistor can
be inserted in one of the conductor paths. For example, a short n+ region can
be implanted during the source>drain step and contacted at each end by one
of the conductors. The other conductor can then cross over the oxide layer
above the n+ region. Usually, this can be accomplished without appreciable
increase in resistance, since the n+ region is heavily doped and its length can
be made small.
During the metallization step, appropriate points in the circuit are connected to relatively large pads to provide for external contacts. These metal
pads are visible in photographs of monolithic circuits as rectangular areas
spaced around the periphery of the device. In the mounting and packaging
process, these pads are contacted by small Au or Al wires or by special techniques such as those discussed in Section 9.6.
One of the most interesting and broadly useful integrated devices is the
charge-coupled device (CCD). The CCD is part of a broader class of structures known generally as charge transfer devices. These are dynamic devices
that move charge along a predetermined path under the control of clock
pulses. These devices find applications in signal processing and imaging. In
this section we lay the groundwork for understanding these devices, but

their present forms and variety of applications must be found in the current
literature.
9.4.1 dynamic effects in MOs Capacitors
The basis of the CCD is the dynamic storage and withdrawal of charge in a
series of MOS capacitors.Thus we must begin by extending the MOS discussion of Chapter 6 to include the basics of dynamic effects. Figure 9–15 shows
an MOS capacitor on a p-type substrate with a large positive gate pulse
applied. A depletion region exists under the gate, and the surface potential
increases considerably under the gate electrode. In effect, the surface potential forms a potential well, which can be exploited for the storage of charge.
If the positive gate bias has been applied for a sufficiently long time,
electrons accumulate at the surface and the steady state inversion condition is established. The source of these carriers is the thermal generation
of electrons at or near the surface. In effect, the inversion charge tells us
the capacity of the well for storage charge. The time required to fill the well
thermally is called the thermal relaxation time, and it depends on the quality
of the semiconductor material and its interface with the insulator. For good
materials the thermal relaxation time can be much longer than the charge
storage times involved in CCD operation.
If instead of a steady state bias we apply a large positive pulse to the
MOS gate electrode, a deep potential well is first created. Before inversion
has occurred by thermal generation, the depletion width is greater than it
would be at equilibrium (W 7 Wm). This transient condition is sometimes
called deep depletion. If we can inject electrons into this potential well electrically or optically, they will be stored there.3 The storage is temporary,

3The potential well should not be confused with the depletion region, which extends into the bulk of the
semiconductor. The “depth” of the well is measured in electrostatic potential, not distance. Electrons stored
in the potential well are in fact located very near the semiconductor surface.

however, because we must move the electrons out to another storage location before thermal generation becomes appreciable.
What is needed is a simple method for allowing charge to flow from
one potential well to an adjacent one quickly and without losing much charge
in the process. If this is accomplished, we can inject, move, and collect packets
of charge dynamically to do a variety of electronic functions.
9.4.2 the basic CCd
The original CCD structure proposed in 1969 by Boyle and Smith of Bell
Laboratories consisted of a series of metal electrodes forming an array
of MOS capacitors as shown in Fig. 9–16. Voltage pulses are supplied in
three lines (L1, L2, L3), each connected to every third electrode in the row
(G1, G2, G3). These voltages are clocked to provide potential wells, which
vary with time as in Fig. 9–16. At time t1 a potential well exists under each
G1 electrode, and we assume this well contains a packet of electrons from
a previous operation. At time t2 a potential is applied also to the adjacent
electrode G2, and the charge equalizes across the common G1-G2 well. It
is easy to visualize this process by thinking of the mobile charge in analogy

wells. At t3 the

with a fluid, which flows to equalize its level in the expanding container. This
fluid model continues at t3 when V1 is reduced, thus decreasing the potential
well under G1. Now the charge flows into the G2 well, and this process is
completed at t4 when V1 is zero. By this process the packet of charge has been
moved from under G1 to G2. As the procedure is continued, the charge is next
passed to the G3 position, and continues down the line as time proceeds. In
this way charge can be injected using an input diode, transported down the
line, and detected at the other end.
9.4.3 Improvements on the basic structure
Several problems arise in the implementation of the CCD structure of Fig.9–16.
For example, the separation between electrodes must be very small to allow
coupling between the wells. An improvement can be made by using an overlapping gate structure such as that shown in Fig. 9–17. This can be done, for
example, with poly-Si electrodes separated by SiO2 or with alternating poly-Si
and metal electrodes.
One of the problems inherent to the charge transfer process is that
some charge is inevitably lost during the many transfers along the CCD. If
the charges are stored at the Si-SiO2 interface, surface states trap a certain
amount of charge. Thus if the “0” logic condition is an empty well, the leading
edge of a train of pulses is degraded by the loss of charge required in filling the traps which were empty in the “0” condition. One way of improving
this situation is to provide enough bias in the “0” state to accommodate the
interface and bulk traps. This procedure is colorfully referred to as using a
fat zero. Even with the use of fat zeros, the signal is degraded after a number
of transfers, by inherent inefficiencies in the transfer process.
Transfer efficiency can be improved by moving the charge transfer layer
below the semiconductor–insulator interface. This can be accomplished by
using ion implantation or epitaxial growth to create a layer of opposite type
than the substrate. This shifts the maximum potential under each electrode
into the semiconductor bulk, thus avoiding the semiconductor–insulator
interface. This type of device is referred to as a buried channel CCD.
The three-phase CCD shown in Fig. 9–16 is only one example of a
variety of CCD structures. Figure 9–18 illustrates one method for achieving
a two-phase system, in which voltages are sequentially applied to alternating

gate electrodes from two lines. A two-level poly-Si gate structure is used,
in which the gate electrodes overlap, and a donor implant near the Si surface creates a built-in well under half of each electrode. When both gates
are turned off (b), potential wells exist only under the implanted regions,
and charge can be stored in any of these wells. With electrode G2 pulsed
positively, the charge packet shown in (b) is transferred to the deepest well
under G2, which is its implanted region as (c) indicates. Then with both gates
off, the wells appear as in (b) again, except that the charge is now under the
G2 electrode. The next step in the transfer process is obviously to pulse G1
positively, so that the charge moves to the implanted region under the G1
electrode to the right.
Other improvements to the basic structure are important in various
applications. These include channel stops or other methods for achieving
lateral confinement for the stored charge. Regeneration points must be
included in the array to refresh the signal after it has been degraded.
9.4.4 Applications of CCds
CCDs are used in a number of ways, including signal processing functions
such as delay, filtering, and multiplexing several signals. Another interesting
application of CCDs is in imaging for astronomy or in solid state cameras,
in which an array of photosensors is used to form charge packets proportional to light intensity, and these packets are shifted to a detector point for
readout. There are numerous ways of accomplishing this in CCDs, including
the linear array line scanner, in which the second dimension is obtained by
moving the scanner relative to the image. Alternatively, an area image sensor

In the early development of integrated circuits it was felt that the inevitable
defects that occur in processing would prevent the fabrication of devices containing more than a few dozen logic gates. One approach to integration on a
larger scale tried in the late 1960s involved fabricating many identical logic
gates on a wafer, testing them, and interconnecting the good ones (a process
called discretionary wiring). While this approach was being developed, however, radical improvements were made in device processing which increased
the yield of good chips on a wafer dramatically. By the early 1970s it was
possible to build circuits with many hundreds of components per chip, with
reasonable yield. These improvements made discretionary wiring obsolete
almost as soon as it was developed. By reducing the number of processing
defects, improving the packing density of components, and increasing the
wafer size, it is now possible to place millions of device elements on a single
chip of silicon and to obtain many perfect chips per wafer.
A major factor in the development of integrated circuits has been the
continual reduction in size of the individual elements (transistors, capacitors)
within each circuit. Through improved design and better lithography, there
has been a dramatic shrinking of the minimum feature size (e.g., a transistor gate) used in these devices. The results of shrinking the elements in a
256-Mb-DRAM are shown in Fig. 9–20. By reducing the minimum feature506 Chapter 9
size in successive steps from 0.13 to 0.11 om, the die area was reduced from
about 135 mm2 in the first-generation design to less than 42 mm2 in the
fifth-generation device. Obviously, more of the smaller chips can be made
by batch fabrication on the wafer, and the effort in shrinking the design is
rewarded in a more profitable device.
Successive designs using reduced feature sizes have made dramatically
increased circuit complexity possible. DRAM design has set the pace over
the past two decades, in which successive 1-Mb, 4-Mb, and 16-Mb memories
led to similar powers of two increase to the Gb range. Figure 9–21 illustrates
the size comparison of a 128-Mb memory with an equivalent amount of
memory in the form of two 64-Mb and eight 16-Mb chips. These are examples
of ULSI.
Although the achievement of many powers of two in memory is
impressive and important, other ULSI chips are important for the integration of many different system functions. A microprocessor includes functions

for a computer central processing unit (CPU), along with memory, control,
timing, and interface circuits required to perform very complex computing
functions. The complexity of such devices is shown in Fig. 9–22, which illustrates a microprocessor chip.
Before leaving this section it might be useful to provide some calibration regarding the dimensions we have been discussing. Figure 9–23 compares the size of 64-Mb DRAM circuit interconnect elements with a human
hair, on the same scale. We can see that the densely packed 0.18 mm lines on
this ULSI memory chip are dwarfed by the scanning electron micrograph of
a human hair which has the diameter of about 50 microns. Current generation DRAMs have feature sizes of ∼25 nm (0.025 mm).
Although the focus of this book is devices and not circuits, it is important to look at some typical applications of MOS capacitors and FETs in
semiconductor logic and memory ULSI, which constitute about 90, of all
ICs. This should give the reader a better feel for why we have studied the
physics of MOS devices in Chapter 6. This is clearly not a comprehensive discussion, because the design and analysis of circuits is a large subject covered
in other books and courses. We will first look at some digital logic applications, followed by some typical memory devices.
9.5.1 logic devices
A very simple and basic circuit element is the inverter, which serves to flip
the logic state. When its input voltage is high (corresponding to logic “1”), its
output voltage is low (logic “0”), and vice versa. Let us start the analysis with
Figure 9–22

a resistor-loaded n-channel MOSFET inverter to illustrate the principles in
the simplest possible manner (Fig. 9–24a).Then, we will extend the treatment
to the slightly more complicated CMOS inverters which are much more useful and more common today.
A key concept for inverters is the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC),
which is a plot of the output voltage as a function of the input bias (Fig. 9–24c).
The VTC gives us information, for example, about how much noise the digital
circuit can handle, and the speed of switching of the logic gates. There are five

key operating points (marked I through V) on the VTC. They include VOH,
corresponding to the logic high or “1”, VOL, corresponding to the logic low
or “0”, and Vm, corresponding to the intersection of a line with unity slope
(where Vout = Vin) with the VTC. Vm, known as the logic threshold (not to
be confused with the VT of the MOSFETs), is important when two inverters are cross-coupled in a flip-flop circuit because the output of one is fed
to the input of the other, and vice versa. Two other key points are the unity
gain points, VIL and VIH. The significance of these points is that if the input
voltage is between them, the change of the input is amplified and we get
a larger change of the output voltage. Outside of this operating range, the
change of the input voltage is attenuated. Clearly, any noise voltage which
puts the input voltage between VIL and VIH would be amplified, and lead to
a potential problem with the circuit operation.
Let us see how to go about determining the VTC. From the circuit in Fig. 9–24a, we see that in the output loop from the power supply to
ground, the current through the resistor load is the same as the drain current of the MOSFET. The power supply voltage is equal to the voltage drop
across the resistor plus the drain-to-source voltage. To determine the VTC, we
superimpose the load line of the load element (in this case a straight line for
an ohmic resistor) on the output characteristics of the MOSFET (Fig. 9–24b).
This is similar to our load line discussion in Section 6.1.1. The load line goes
through VDD on the voltage axis because when the current in the output loop

is zero, there is no voltage drop across the resistor and all the voltage appears
across the MOSFET. On the current axis, the load line goes through VDD>RL
because when the voltage across the MOSFET is zero, the voltage across the
resistor must be VDD. As we change the input bias, Vin, we change the gate
bias on the MOSFET, and thus in Fig. 9–24b, we go from one constant VG
curve to the next. At each input bias (and a corresponding constant VG curve)
the intersection of the load line with that curve tells us what the drain bias
VD is, which is the same as the output voltage. This is because at the point of
intersection, we satisfy the condition that for the d-c case where the capacitor does not play any role, the current through the resistor is the same as the
MOSFET current. (Later on, we shall see that in the a-c case when the logic
gates are switched, we need to worry about the displacement current through
the capacitor when it is charged or discharged.) It can be clearly seen from
Fig. 9–24c that as the input voltage (or VG) changes from low to high, the
output voltage decreases from a high of VDD to a low of VOL. We can solve
for any point on this VTC curve analytically simply by recognizing whether
the MOSFET is in the linear region or in saturation, using the corresponding drain current expression [Eq. (6–49) or (6–53)] and setting it equal to the
resistor current. As an illustration, suppose we want to determine the logic
“0” level, VOL.This occurs when the input VG is high and the output VD is
low, putting the transistor in the linear region. Using Eq. (6–49), we can write
ID
= kc VG - VT - V2D d VD = kc VDD - VT - V2OL d VOL (9–3a)
Since in the d-c case the current through the MOSFET is the same as that
through the resistor,
ID
= IL =
VDD - VOL
RL
(9–3b)
We can solve for VOL if we know RL and the MOSFET parameters. Alternatively, we can design the value of RL to achieve a certain VOL.
What might dictate the choice of RL? We shall see later in this section that
for many applications we use two of these inverters in a cross-coupled manner to form a bistable flip-flop. The output of one inverter is fed back to the
input of the other, and vice versa. Clearly, the VOL must be designed to be
significantly less than the VT of the MOSFET. Otherwise, neither MOSFET
will be fully turned off, and the flip-flop will not function properly. Similarly,
all the other points on the VTC can be determined analytically by using the
appropriate MOSFET drain current expression, and setting it equal to the
current through the resistor.
We can make some general observations from this analysis. We want
the transition region of the VTC (between VIL and VIH) to be as steep (i.e.,
high gain) as possible, and the transition should be around VDD>2. High
gain guarantees a high-speed transition from one logic state to the other. ItIntegrated Circuits 511
is necessary to increase the load resistance to increase this gain in the transition region.
The transition around VDD>2 guarantees high noise immunity or margin for both logic “1” and logic “0” levels. To appreciate the importance of
noise immunity, we must recognize that in combinatorial or sequential digital
circuits, the output of one inverter or logic gate is often fed into the input
of the next stage. Noise immunity is a measure of how much noise voltage
the circuit can tolerate at the input, and still have the digital outputs be at
the correct logic level in the subsequent stages. For example in Fig. 9–24c,
if the input is nominally at zero, the output should be high (logic “1”). If this
is fed into another inverter stage, its output should be low, and so on. If a
noise spike causes the input of the first stage to go above Vm, the output voltage decreases sufficiently to potentially create errors in the digital levels in
subsequent stages. Having a symmetric transition of the VTC around VDD>2
ensures that the noise margin is high for both logic levels.
One problem with the resistor load inverter is that the VOL is low, but
not zero. This, coupled with the fact that the load element is a passive resistor that cannot be turned off, causes high standby power dissipation in this
circuit. These problems are addressed by the CMOS structure described next.
We can determine the VTC for the CMOS case exactly as for the resistor
load, although the math is somewhat more messy (Fig. 9–25). As mentioned
previously, for an input voltage Vin, the VG of the NMOSFET is Vin, but that of
the PMOSFET is Vin - VDD. Similarly, if the output voltage is Vout, the VD of the
NMOSFET is Vout, but that of the PMOS is Vout - VDD. The load element now
is not a simple resistor with a linear current–voltage relationship, but instead is
the PMOSFET device whose “load line” is a set of ID - VD output characteristics (Fig.9–25b). The Vout can be determined as a function of the Vin by recognizing whether the NMOSFET and the PMOSFET are in the linear or saturation
region of their characteristics, and using the appropriate current expressions. At
each point, we would set the NMOSFET ID equal to the PMOSFET ID.
As in the case of the resistive load, there are five key points on the
VTC (Fig. 9–25c). They are logic “1” equal to VDD, logic “0” equal to 0, logic
threshold V
m where Vin = Vout, and the two unity gain points, VIH and VIL.
In region I in Fig. 9–25c, the NMOSFET is OFF, and Vout = VDD. Similarly, in
region V, the PMOSFET is OFF, and Vout = 0. We can illustrate the calculation in region II, where the NMOSFET is in saturation and the PMOSFET
is in the linear region. In this case, we must use Eq. (6–53) for the saturation
drain current of the NMOSFET. We are considering the long channel case.

Here VTN and VTP are the n- and p-channel threshold voltages. In the d-c
case, since the output load capacitor does not play a role, the drain current
through the PMOSFET device must be equal in magnitude to that through
the NMOSFET. (However, for the a-c case, we need to consider the displacement current through the capacitor.)

From Eq. (9–5b), we can get an analytical relation between the input and
output voltages valid in region II. We can get similar relationships in the
other regions of the VTC.
Region IV is very similar to region II in Fig. 9–25c, except that now the
NMOS is in the linear regime, while the PMOSFET is in saturation. In region
III, both the NMOSFET and the PMOSFET are in saturation. Since the
output impedance of a MOSFET is very high, this is tantamount to a semiinfinite load resistor, thereby resulting in a very steep transition region. That
is why a CMOS inverter switches faster than the resistor load case. The
CMOS inverter is also preferable because in either logic state (regions I or
V), either the NMOSFET or the PMOSFET is OFF, and the standby power
dissipation is very low. In fact, the current in either logic state corresponds
to the (very low) source>drain diode leakage.
We want the transition region (region III) to be at VDD>2 from the point of
view of symmetry and noise immunity. Once again, by setting the NMOSFET ID
equal to that of the PMOSFET, it can be shown that the transition occurs at
Vin = (VDD + xVTN + VTP) > (1 + x) (9–6a)
where
x = akkNP b 1 2 = c mnCiaZ L b N d 1 2
c mpCiaZ L b P d 1 2 (9–6b)
We can design Vin to be at VDD>2 by choosing VTN = -VTP and x = 1. Since
the effective electron mobility in the channel of a Si MOSFET is roughly
twice that of the hole mobility, we must design CMOS circuits to have a
(Z>L)P = 2(Z>L)N to achieve the condition x = 1.514 Chapter 9
We can combine such CMOS inverters to form other logic gates for
combinatorial circuits such as NOR gates and NAND gates (Fig. 9–26). The
truth tables for these gates are shown in Fig. 9–27. By applying combinations
of logic “high” or logic “low” to inputs A and B, we get the output states corresponding to the truth tables. The synthesis of logic circuits corresponding
to these truth tables can be done using Boolean algebra and De Morgan’s
laws. The upshot of these laws is that any logic circuit can be made using
inverters in conjunction with either NAND gates or NOR gates. Which would
be preferable from a device physics point of view? We see from Fig. 9–26, that
in the NOR gate the PMOSFET devices T3 and T4 are in series, while for the
NAND it is the NMOSFETs (T1 and T2). Since the electron channel mobilities
are twice hole mobilities, we would obviously prefer NMOSFETs. Therefore,
the preferred choice is NAND, along with inverters.

We can also estimate the power dissipation in the inverter circuit. We
already know that the standby power dissipation is very small, being governed by the OFF state leakage current of either the NMOSFET or the
PMOSFET, depending on the logic state. This leakage current depends
on the source and drain diode leakage currents, or if the VT is low, on the
subthreshold leakage of the MOSFET that is turned OFF (see Section
6.5.7).
While the inverter is switching, there is also a transient current from the
power supply to ground when both the transistors are ON (see Fig. 9–25d).
This is known as the switching current or the commutator current. The magnitude of this current will clearly depend on the values of VTN and VTP. The
higher the magnitudes of the thresholds, the less is the input voltage swing
for which both the PMOSFET and the NMOSFET will be ON while the
input voltage is being changed. The commutator current is then less during switching, which is desirable from a reduced power dissipation point of
view. However, this reduction of power dissipation by increasing threshold
voltages is obtained at the expense of reduced drive current and, therefore,
overall speed of the circuit.

The speed penalty due to reduction of drive current is because in a digital circuit, while switching between logic states, the MOSFET drive currents
must charge and discharge the parasitic capacitors that are inevitably associated with the output node (Fig. 9–25a).There is also some power dissipation
involved in charging and discharging load capacitors attached to the output
of the inverter. This load capacitance depends mostly on the input gate oxide
capacitance of the MOSFETs of the next inverter stage (or logic gate) that
this inverter (or logic gate) may be driving, along with some small parasitic
capacitances. The input load capacitance of a single inverter is given by gate
oxide capacitance per unit area Ci times the device areas.
Cinv = Ci5(ZL)N + (ZL)P6 (9–7)
The total load capacitance is then multiplied by a factor that depends on
the fan-out of the circuit, which is the number of gates that are being driven
in parallel by the inverter (or logic gate). It is necessary to add up the load
capacitances for all the inverters or logic gates that are being driven by this
inverter stage. The energy expended in charging up the equivalent load
capacitor, C, is the integral of the product of the time-dependent voltage
times the time-dependent displacement current through the capacitor during
the charging cycle.
EC = Lip(t)[VDD - v(t)]dt
= VDD Lip(t)dt - Lip(t)v(t)dt
(9–8a)
The energy stored in C is then obtained by considering the displacement
current (ip(t) = C dv>dt) through the capacitor:
E
c = VDD LCdv dt dt - LCv dv dt dt
= CVDD L0 VDDdv - C L0 VDDvdv = CV2 DD - 1 2 CVDD 2 (9–8b)
Similarly, during one discharging cycle we get
Ed = Lin(t)v(t)dt = - LV0DDCvdv = 12 CVDD 2 (9–9)
If the inverter (or gate) is being charged and discharged at a frequency f, we
get an active power disspation
P = CV2 DD f (9–10)
In addition to power dissipation, we are also concerned with the speed
of logic circuits. The speed of a gate, such as the one shown in Fig. 9–25, isIntegrated Circuits 517
determined by the propagation delay time tP. We define the time required for
the output to go from the logic high VOH to VOH>2 as tPHL. The converse (to
go from logic low VOL(= 0) to VOH>2) is defined as tPLH. We can write down
approximate estimates for these times by recognizing that for the output to
go from high to low (or logic “1” to “0”), the NMOSFET has to discharge
the output node toward ground. During this period, the NMOSFET will be
in saturation. Assuming a constant saturation current as an approximation,
we obtain from Eq. (6–53)
tPHL =

Knowing these times helps us considerably in designing circuits that meet the
speed requirements of a design. Of course, for accurate numerical estimates
of these propagation time delays or of the power dissipation we need to
use computers. A very popular program to do so is the Simulation Program
with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE). This discussion illustrates that
the device physics plays an important role in the design and analysis of such
circuits.
9.5.2 semiconductor Memories
In addition to logic devices such as microprocessors, integrated circuits
depend on semiconductor memories. We can illustrate many key MOS
device physics issues by looking at three of the most important types of
semiconductor memory cells: the static random-access memory (SRAM), the
dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), and the non-volatile flash memory cell. SRAMs and DRAMs are volatile in the sense that the information
is lost if the power supply is removed. For flash memories, however, information is stored indefinitely. For SRAMs, the information is static, meaning that
as long as the power supply is on, the information is retained. On the other
hand, the information stored in the cells of a DRAM must periodically be
refreshed because stored charge representing one of the logic states leaks
away rapidly. The refresh time must be short compared with the time needed
for stored charge to degrade.
The overall organization of all these types of memories is rather similar,
and is shown in Fig. 9–28. We will not describe the memory organization in518 Chapter 9
great detail here, but will instead focus on the device physics. We need to
know the type of cell that is used at the intersection of the rows or wordlines, and the columns or bitlines. These memories are all random access in
the sense that the cells can be addressed for write or read operations in any
order, depending on the row and column addresses provided to the address
pins, unlike memories such as hard disks or floppy disks on a computer which
can only be addressed sequentially. Generally, the same set of pins is used for
both the row and the column addresses, in order to save pin count. This forces
us to use what is known as address multiplexing. First, the row addresses are
provided at the address pin, and decoded using row decoders. For N row
addresses, we can have 2N rows or wordlines. The row decoders then cause

Organization of a random access memory (RAM): The memory array consists of memory cells arranged
in an orthogonal array. There is one memory cell at the intersection of one row (wordline) and one column
(bitline). To address a particular memory cell, the N row addresses are latched in from the N address pins,
and decoded by the 2N row decoders. All the memory cells on the selected row are read by the 2N sense
amplifiers. Of those, a cell (one bit) or group of cells (byte or word) is selected for transfer to the data output
buffers depending on the column addresses that are decoded by the 2N column decoders. Generally, to
save pin count on the package, the N column addresses are provided in a multiplexed fashion to the same
N address pins as the row addresses, after the row addresses have already been latched in.Integrated Circuits 519

N column addresses) on this wordline are accessed for either read or write,
through sense amplifiers at the end of the 2N columns or bitlines. After the
appropriate row has been decoded, the appropriate column addresses are
provided to the same address pins, and the column decoders are used to
select the bit or group of bits (known as byte or word) out of all the 2N bits
on the selected wordline. We can either write into or read from the selected
bit (or group of bits) using the sense amplifiers, which are basically flip-flops
or differential amplifiers.
srAMs. A group of four 6-transistor CMOS SRAM cells is shown in
Fig. 9–29. Each cell is found in this case at the intersection of a row or
wordline, and a column or bitline (along with its logical complement
known as bitline-bar).The cell is a flip-flop, consisting of two cross-coupled
CMOS inverters. Clearly, it is bistable: if the output of one inverter is high
(corresponding to the NMOSFET being OFF, and the PMOSFET ON),
that high voltage is fed to the input of the other cross-coupled inverter, and
the output of the other inverter will be low. This is one logic state (say “1”)
of the SRAM. Conversely, the other stable state of the flip-flop can be
considered to be the other logic state (say “0”). Many of the device issues

are identical to those described in Section 9.5.1 in connection with the
VTC of inverters. We aim for a symmetric transition from VOH to VOL at
VDD>2 with a high gain in the transition region, to improve noise immunity
and speed of convergence of the SRAM cell. The speed of convergence
determines how fast the SRAM flip-flop latches into one stable logic
state or the other. The cells are accessed through two access transistors
whose gates are controlled by the wordline. That is why this is called a 6-
transistor cell. Other SRAM cells use load resistors in the inverters, rather
than PMOSFETs, leading to a 4-transistor, 2-resistor cell. As discussed in
Section 9.5.1, the CMOS cell has superior performance, but at the expense
of occupying more area.
Unless the row decoders cause a particular wordline to go high, the
SRAM cells on that wordline are electrically isolated. By selecting a particular wordline, the access transistors on that row are turned ON and act
as logic transmission gates between the output nodes of the SRAM cell and
the bitline and its complement, the bitline-bar. During a read operation, the
bitline and its complement are both precharged to the same voltage. Once
the access transistors are turned ON, a small voltage differential develops
between bitline and bitline-bar because the output nodes of the SRAM
are at different voltages (0 and VDD). The voltage differential that is established is due to a charge redistribution that occurs between the parasitic
capacitance associated with the output nodes of the SRAM and the bitline
capacitance. This voltage difference is amplified by the sense amplifiers. As
mentioned previously, the sense amplifiers are differential amplifiers, very
similar in configuration to the SRAM flip-flop cell itself. The bitline and
bitline-bar (complement of the bitline) are fed to the two inputs of the sense
amplifier, and the voltage differential is amplified until the voltage separation is VDD.
drAMs. The DRAM cell structure is shown in Fig. 9–30. The information
is stored as charge on an MOS capacitor, which is connected to the bitline
through a switch which is an MOS pass transistor, the gate of which is
controlled by the wordline. There is one such cell at each intersection of the
orthogonal array of wordlines and bitlines, exactly as for SRAMs. When
the wordline voltage becomes higher than the VT of the pass transistor
(MOSFET between the bitline and the storage capacitor), the channel is
turned ON, and connects the bitline to the MOS storage capacitor. The
gate of this capacitor (or capacitor plate) is permanently connected to the
power supply voltage VDD, thereby creating a potential well under it which
tends to be full of inversion electrons for a p-type substrate (Fig. 9–31a).
We apply either 0 V to the bitline (generally corresponding to logic “0”),
or VDD (corresponding to logic “1”), and the appropriate voltage appears
as the substrate potential of the MOS capacitor. For a stored “0” in the cell,
the potential well that is created under the MOS capacitor by the plate
voltage is full of inversion charge (Fig. 9–31b,c). When the wordlineIntegrated Circuits 521
voltage is turned low such that the MOS pass transistor is turned off, the
inversion charge under the storage capacitor stays the same; this is the
stable state of the capacitor. On the other hand, if a positive voltage (VDD)
is applied to the bitline, it draws out the inversion electrons through the
pass transistor (Fig. 9–31d,e). When the pass transistor is cut off, we end
up with an empty potential well under the MOS capacitor plate. Over
a period of time, the potential well tends to be filled up by minority
carrier electrons that are constantly created by thermal generation–
recombination in the substrate and are collected under the charged MOS
capacitor plate. Hence, the logic “1” degrades towards the logic “0”. That
is why a DRAM is considered to be “dynamic” unlike an SRAM. It is
necessary to periodically restore the logic levels or “refresh” the stored
information.
There are interesting device physics issues regarding the pass transistor. This is like the access transistor in the SRAM, or a logic transmission gate. We see that in this MOSFET, neither the source nor the drain is
permanently grounded. In fact, which side acts as the source and which as
the drain depends on the circuit operation. When we are writing a logic “1”
into the cell, the bitline voltage is held high (=VDD). As this voltage is written into the cell, it is as if the source of the pass transistor gets charged up
to VDD. Another way of looking at this is that with respect to the source, the
substrate bias of the pass transistor is -VDD. The body effect of the MOSFET
(Section 6.5.6) causes its VT to increase. This is very important because for
the pass transistor to operate as a transmission gate it is necessary that it be in
the linear regime throughout, and not get into saturation (with a concomitant
voltage drop across the pinch-off region). Hence, the gate or the wordline
voltage must be held at VDD (which is the final voltage of the source>drains)
plus the VT of the MOSFET, taking body effect into account. It is also important to make sure that the leakage of the pass transistor is low enough to

satisfy refresh requirements of the DRAM. Not only must the source>drain
diodes be low leakage, but the VT and the subthreshold slope must be optimized such that subthreshold leakage for the grounded wordline case is low
enough.
The stored charge difference between the two logic states can be determined by looking at the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of the
MOS capacitor (Fig. 9–32). For a stored “1”, essentially there is a substrate
bias applied to the MOS capacitor, which raises its VT due to the body effect
(Section 6.5.6). Hence, the C–V characteristics shift to the right for a stored
“1”. Since the MOS capacitance is not a fixed capacitance, but is voltage
dependent, we saw earlier that it must be defined in a differential form
[Eq. (6–34a)]. Alternatively, we can write down the stored charge under the
capacitor as
Q = LC(V )dV (9–12)
This is simply the area under the C–V curve. The charge differential that
distinguishes the logic “1” and the logic “0” is the difference of areas under
the capacitance–voltage curves in the two cases (Fig. 9–32).
When reading the cell, the pass transistor is turned on, and the
MOS storage capacitor charge is dumped on the bitline capacitance CB,
precharged to VB (typically = VDD). The swing of the bitline voltage will
clearly depend on the voltage VC stored in the storage cell capacitance
CC. As in the case of the SRAM, the change of the bitline voltage depends

on the capacitance ratio between the bitline and the cell. To do differential sensing in the case of DRAMs, we do not use two bitlines per cell as
for SRAMs. Instead, we compare the bitline voltage for the selected cell
with a reference bitline voltage to which is connected a dummy cell whose
MOS capacitance, CD, is roughly half that of the actual cell capacitance, CC.
Typical values of CB, CC, and CD in a DRAM are 800 fF, 50 fF, and 20 fF,
respectively. The voltage differential that is applied to the sense amplifier
then becomes (Fig. 9–33)
∆V =

CCVD + CBVB
CB + CD
=
(VB - VD)CBCD - (VB - VC)CBCC - (VC - VD)CCCD
(CB + CC)(CB + CD)
(9–13a)
If VD is set to zero, the expression simplifies to:
∆V =
(VBCB - VCCC)CD - (VB - VC)CBCC
(CB + CC)(CB + CD) (9–13b)
Putting the cell voltage VC equal to 0 V or 5 V, and typical, acceptable bitlineto-cell capacitance ratios CB>CC(= 15-20) in Eq. (9–13b), we get different
polarities of the differential voltage of the order of {100 mV for logic “1”
and logic “0”, respectively, which can be detected by sense amplifiers. From
Eq. (9–13b), it can be seen that for much higher bitline-to-cell capacitance
ratios, the swing of the bitline voltage will be negligible, regardless of the cell
voltage. The minimum required cell capacitance CC is about 50 fF, governed
by so-called soft errors. DRAMs, like everything else on Earth, are constantly being bombarded by cosmic rays, and high-energy alpha particles can
create electron–hole pairs in semiconductors. A typical collected charge due

to one of these events is about 100 fC. This spurious charge can be neglected
if the cell capacitance is 50 fF and 5 V is applied to the cell, for which the
stored charge is roughly 250 fC. The DRAM cell then becomes immune to
typical alpha particle hits.
Maintaining a cell capacitance of 50 fF as the cell dimensions are
reduced from one generation of DRAM to the next is a tremendous
technological challenge. One way to look at this problem is shown in
Fig. 9–34. The challenge is to store more charge per unit area on the
planar surface (As) of the Si substrate. Approximating the MOS capacitance as a fixed, voltage-independent capacitor, we can write the stored
charge Q as
Q = CV = (PAC > d)V (9–14)
where g is the permittivity of the dielectric, d is its thickness, and AC is
the capacitor area. As shown in Fig. 9–34, the historical way of achieving

Various approaches (past, present, and future) of achieving higher DRAM cell capacitance and charge
storage density without increasing cell size. As = Area on wafer taken by capacitor; Ac = Area of
capacitor. For a planar capacitor Ac = As; however, for nonplanar structures Ac 7 As. C = Ac P>d is
the capacitance; and Q = CV is the total stored charge in a fixed, voltage-independent capacitor.526 Chapter 9
the desired capacitance has been to scale the dielectric thickness, d. But
that runs into the problems discussed in Section 6.4.7. Another approach,
which is being taken currently, is to use fabrication schemes to increase
the area devoted to the MOS storage capacitor, Ac, even as we reduce the
planar surface area on the wafer, As, used for making this storage capacitance. Obviously, this can be done by moving away from a purely planar
structure, and exploiting the third dimension. We can go down into the Si by
digging “trenches” in the substrate with RIE and forming a trench storage
capacitor on the sidewalls of the trench (Fig. 9–35a). Alternatively, we can
go up from the substrate by stacking multiple layers of capacitor electrodes
to increase the “stacked” capacitor area (Fig. 9–35b). Other tricks that have
been tried are to purposely create a rough polysilicon surface on the capacitor plates to increase the surface area. In the future, alternative materials
may be used. For example, the ferroelectrics have much higher dielectric
constant than SiO2 and offer larger capacitance without increasing area or
reducing thickness. Promising materials include barium strontium titanate
and zirconium oxide.
Flash Memories. Another interesting MOS device is the flash memory,
which is the most important type of nonvolatile memory. The memory cell
structure is shown in Fig. 9–36. It is very simple and compact, and looks just
like a MOSFET, except that it has two gate electrodes, one on top of the
other. The top electrode is the one that we have direct electrical access to,

and is known as the control gate. Below that we have a so-called “floating”
gate that is capacitively coupled to the control gate and the underlying
silicon.
The capacitive coupling of the floating gate to the various terminals
is illustrated in Fig. 9–36 in terms of the various coupling capacitance components. The floating gate and the control gate are separated by a stacked
oxide–nitride–oxide dielectric in typical flash devices. The capacitance
between these two gates is called CONO because of the oxide–nitride–oxide
makeup of the dielectric stack. The total capacitance CTOT is the sum of all
the parallel components shown in Fig. 9–36.
CTOT = CONO + CTOX + CFLD + CSRC + CDRN (9–15)
where CTOX is the floating gate-to-channel capacitance through the tunnel oxide, CFLD is the floating gate-to-substrate capacitance in the LOCOS
field oxide region, and CSRC and CDRN are the gate-to-source/drain overlap
capacitances.
Since it is isolated by the surrounding dielectrics, the charge on the
floating gate QFG is not changed by (moderate) changes of the terminal
biases.
QFG = 0 = CONO(VFG - VG) + CSRC(VFG - VS)
+ CDRN(VFG - VD) (9–16)
We assume that the substrate bias is fixed, and hence ignore the contributions
from CTOX and CFLD, which couple the floating gate to the substrate. The

voltages, in terms of the gate, drain, and source coupling ratios as defined in

The basic cell operation involves putting charge on the floating gate
or removing it, in order to program the MOSFET to have two different
VT>s, corresponding to two logic levels. We can think of the stored charge
on the floating gate to be like the fixed oxide charge in the VT expression
[Eq. (6–38)]. If many electrons are stored in the floating gate, the VT of an
NMOSFET is high; the cell is considered to have been “programmed” to
exhibit the logic state “0”. On the contrary, if electrons have been removed
from the floating gate, the cell is considered to have been “erased” into a low
VT state or logic “1”.
How do we go about transferring charges into and out of the floating
gate? To program the cell, we can use channel hot carrier effects that we
discussed in Section 6.5.9. We apply a high field to both the drain (bitline)
and floating gate (wordline) such that the MOSFET is in saturation. It was
discussed in Section 6.5.9 that the high longitudinal electric field in the pinchoff region accelerates electrons toward the drain and makes them energetic
(hot). We maximize such hot carrier effects near the drain pinch-off region
in a flash device by making the drain junction somewhat shallower than
the source junction (Fig. 9–37a). This can be achieved by a separate higher
energy source implant that is masked in the drain region. If the kinetic energy
of electrons is high enough, a few can become hot enough to be scattered into
the floating gate. They must surmount the 3.1-eV energy barrier that exists
between the conduction band of Si and that of SiO2, or hot electrons can
tunnel through the oxide (Fig. 9–37b). Once they get into the floating gate,
electrons become trapped in the 3.1-eV potential well between the floating
polysilicon gate and the oxides on either side. This barrier is extremely high
for a trapped (low kinetic energy) electron. Therefore the trapped electrons
essentially stay in the floating gate forever, unless the cell is intentionally
erased. That is why a flash memory is nonvolatile.
To erase the cell, we use Fowler–Nordheim tunneling between the
floating gate and the source in the overlap region (Fig. 9–38a). A high
positive voltage (say ∼12 V) is applied to the source with the control gateIntegrated Circuits 529
grounded. The polarity of the field is such that electrons tunnel from the
floating gate into the source region, through the oxide barrier (Section 6.4.7).
The band diagram (along a vertical line in this overlap region) during the
operation is shown in Fig. 9–38b. Interestingly, in a flash device we make use
of two effects that are considered to be “problems” in regular MOS devices:
hot carrier effects and Fowler–Nordheim tunneling.

During the read operation, we apply a moderate voltage (∼ 1 V) to the
bitline (drain of the MOSFET), and a wordline (control gate) voltage VCG that
causes the capacitively coupled floating gate voltage to be between that of the
high VT and the low VT state of the programmed flash memory cell (Fig. 9–39).
There will be negligible drain current flow in the bit line (drain) for the high
VT case because the gate voltage is less than the threshold voltage. We will
then interpret the selected cell as being in state “0”. For the low VT case, since
the applied gate voltage is higher than the threshold voltage of the cell, there
will be drain current flow in the bitline (drain), and this can be interpreted as
state “1”. The read operation can be understood by looking at the transfer characteristics of the MOSFET in the programmed and erased states (Fig. 9–39).

After the preceding discussions of rather dramatic fabrication steps in monolithic circuit technology, the processes of attaching leads and packaging the
devices could seem rather mundane. Such an impression would be far from
accurate, however, since the techniques discussed in this section are crucial
to the overall fabrication process. In fact, the handling and packaging of individual circuits can be the most critical steps of all from the viewpoints of cost
and reliability. The individual IC chip must be connected properly to outside
leads and packaged in a way that is convenient for use in a larger circuit or
system. Since the devices are handled individually once they are separated
from the wafer, bonding and packaging are expensive processes. Considerable

work has been done to reduce the steps required in bonding. We shall discuss
the most straightforward technique first, which involves bonding individual
leads from the contact pads on the circuit to terminals in the package. Then
we shall consider two important methods for making all bonds simultaneously. Finally, we shall discuss a few typical packaging methods for ICs.
9.6.1 testing
After the wafer of monolithic circuits has been processed and the final metallization pattern defined, it is placed in a holder under a microscope and is
aligned for testing by a multiple-point probe (Fig. 9–40). The probe contacts
the various pads on an individual circuit, and a series of tests are made of
the electrical properties of the device. The various tests are programmed to
be made automatically in a very short time. These tests may take only milliseconds for a simple circuit, to several seconds for a complex ULSI chip. The
information from these tests is fed into a computer, which compares the results
with information stored in its memory, and a decision is made regarding the
acceptability of the circuit. If there is some defect so that the circuit falls below
specifications, the computer remembers that chip must be discarded. The
probe automatically steps the prescribed distance to the next circuit on the
wafer and repeats the process. After all of the circuits have been tested and
the substandard ones noted, the wafer is removed from the testing machine,
sawed between the circuits, and broken apart (Fig. 9–41). Then each die that
passed the test is picked up and placed in the package. In the testing process,
information from tests on each die can be stored to facilitate analysis of the
rejected circuits or to evaluate the fabrication process for possible changes.
9.6.2 Wire bonding
The earliest method used for making contacts from the monolithic chip to the
package was the bonding of fine Au wires. Later techniques expanded wire
bonding to include Al wires and several types of bonding processes. Here
we shall outline only a few of the most important aspects of wire bonding.
If the chip is to be wire bonded, it is first mounted solidly on a metal lead
frame or on a metallized region in the package. In this process a thin layer of
Au (perhaps combined with Ge or other elements to improve the metallurgy
of the bond) is placed between the bottom of the chip and the substrate; heat
and a slight scrubbing motion are applied, forming an alloyed bond which holds
the chip firmly to the substrate. This process is called die bonding. Generally, die
bonding is done by a robotic arm that picks up each die, orients it, and places it
for bonding. Once the chip is mounted, the interconnecting wires are attached
from the various contact pads to posts on the package (Fig. 9–42).
In Au wire bonding, a spool of fine Au wire (about 0.007-0.002-inch
diameter) is mounted in a lead bonder apparatus, and the wire is fed through
a glass or tungsten carbide capillary (Fig. 9–43a).A hydrogen gas flame jet is
swept past the wire to form a ball on the end. In thermocompression bonding
the chip (or in some cases the capillary) is heated to about 360°C, and the
capillary is brought down over the contact pad. When pressure is exerted532 Chapter 9

by the capillary on the ball, a bond is formed between the Au ball and
the Al pad (Fig. 9–43b).Then the capillary is raised and moved to a post on the
package. The capillary is brought down again, and the combination of force
and temperature bonds the wire to the post. After raising the capillary again,
the hydrogen flame is swept past, forming a new ball (Fig. 9–43c); then the
process is repeated for the other pads on the chip.
There are many variations in this basic method. For example, the substrate heating can be eliminated by ultrasonic bonding. In this method a
tungsten carbide capillary is held by a tool connected to an ultrasonic transducer. When it is in contact with a pad or a post, the wire is vibrated under
pressure to form a bond. Other variations include techniques for automatically removing the “tail,” which is left on the post in Fig. 9–43c. When the
bond to the chip is made by exerting pressure on a ball at the end of the Au
wire, it is called a ball bond or a nail-head bond, because of the shape of the
deformed ball after the bond is made (Fig. 9–44a).
Aluminum wire can be used in ultrasonic bonding; it has several advantages over Au, including the absence of possible metallurgical problems in
bonds between Au and Al pads. When Al wire is used, the flame-off step is
replaced by cutting or breaking the wire at appropriate points in the process. In forming a bond, the wire is bent under the edge of a wedge-shaped
bonding tool (Fig. 9–43d).The tool then applies pressure and ultrasonic vibration, forming the bond (Fig. 9–43e and f).The resulting flat bond, formed by
the bent wire wedged between the tool and the bonding surface, is called a
wedge bond. A closeup view of ball and wedge bonds is given in Fig. 9–44.Integrated Circuits 535
9.6.3 Flip-Chip techniques
The time consumed in bonding wires individually to each pad on the chip
can be overcome by several methods of simultaneous bonding. The flip-chip
approach is typical of these methods. Relatively thick metal is deposited on
the contact pads before the devices are separated from the wafer. After separation, the deposited metal is used to contact a matching metallized pattern
on the package substrate.
In the flip-chip method, “bumps” of solder or special metal alloys are
deposited on each contact pad. These metal bumps can be distributed over the
die (Fig.9–45).After separation from the wafer, each chip is turned upside down,
and the bumps are properly aligned with the metallization pattern on the substrate. At this point, ultrasonic bonding or solder attaches each bump to its corresponding connector on the substrate. An obvious advantage of this method
is that all connections are made simultaneously. Disadvantages include the fact
that the bonds are made under the chip and therefore cannot be inspected visually. Furthermore, it is necessary to heat and>or exert pressure on the chip.
9.6.4 Packaging
The final step in IC fabrication is packaging the device in a suitable medium
that can protect it from the environment of its intended application. In most
cases this means the surface of the device must be isolated from moisture
and contaminants and the bonds and other elements must be protected from
corrosion and mechanical shock. The problems of surface protection are
greatly minimized by modern passivation techniques, but it is still necessary
to provide some protection in the packaging. In every case, the choice of
package type must be made within the requirements of the application and
cost considerations. There are many techniques for encapsulating devices,
and the various methods are constantly refined and changed. Here we shall
consider just a few general methods for the purpose of illustration.
(a) (b)

Technology, Inc. All rights reserved. Used with permission.)536 Chapter 9
In the early days of IC technology, all devices were packaged in metal
headers. In this method the device is alloyed to the surface of the header, wire
bonds are made to the header posts, and a metal lid is welded over the device
and wiring. Although this method has several drawbacks, it does provide complete sealing of the unit from the outside environment. This is often called a hermetically sealed device. After the chip is mounted on the header and bonds are
made to the posts, the header cap can be welded shut in a controlled environment (e.g., an inert gas), which maintains the device in a prescribed atmosphere.
Integrated circuits are now mounted in packages with many output
leads (Fig. 9–46). In one version the chip is mounted on a stamped metal
lead frame and wire bonding is done between the chip and the leads. The
package is formed by applying a ceramic or plastic case and trimming away
the unwanted parts of the lead frame.
Broadly speaking, packages can be through-hole-mount that involve
inserting the package pins through holes on the printed circuit board (PCB)
before soldering, or surface-mount type where the leads do not pass through
holes in the PCB. Instead, surface-mounted package leads are aligned to
electrical contacts on the PCB, and are connected simultaneously by solder reflow. Most packages can be made using ceramic or plastic (which is
cheaper). The ICs are hermetically sealed for protection from the environment. The pins can be on one side (single inline or zig-zag pattern of leads),
two sides (dual inline package or DIP) or four sides of the package (quad
package) (Fig. 9–46). More advanced packages have leads distributed over a

large portion of the surface of the package as in through-hole-mounted pin
grid arrays (PGAs) (Fig. 9–47) or surface-mounted ball grid arrays (BGAs)
(Fig. 9–48). By not restricting the leads to the edges of the package, the pin
count can be increased dramatically, which is very attractive for advanced
ULSI in which a large number of electrical leads must be accessed.
Since a sizable fraction of the cost of an IC is due to bonding and
packaging, there have been a number of innovations for automating the
process. These include the use of film reels that contain the metal contact
pattern onto which the chips can be bonded. The film can then be fed
into packaging equipment, where the position registration capabilities of
a film reel can be used for automated handling. This process, called tapeautomated bonding (TAB), is particularly useful in mounting several chips
on a large ceramic substrate having multilevel interconnection patterns
(called a multichip module).
9.1 The progress of ICs can be characterized by an exponential increase in the tran- suMMAry
sistor count and a corresponding decrease in feature size with time (Moore’s
law). The economics are driven by device scaling and batch processing.
9.2 The dominant IC technology is digital CMOS, which is the basis of logic circuits
(microprocessors), memories (DRAMs, SRAMs, and NVM), and applicationspecific ICs (ASICs).

measured sheet resistance of the p-type part? If we have a sheet resistance of
90 Ω>square in the n-type part, what is the average resistivity there?

High-Frequency, High-Power and
Nanoelectronic Devices
The diodes and transistors we have discussed thus far constitute the vast
majority of semiconductor devices. However, there are a number of specialty
devices that deserve our attention, and novel devices and materials can form
the basis of future applications. In this chapter we describe two types of negative conductance devices, with applications in high-frequency circuits. Then
we will discuss the semiconductor controlled rectifier (SCR), an important
switching device which can handle large amounts of power. Finally we will
consider new materials and device applications which depend on some very
interesting extensions of the physics of materials we used in previous chapters. These new materials and new applications of physics will likely form the
basis for the electronics of the future.

The tunnel diode is a p-n junction device that operates in certain regions
of its I–V characteristic by the quantum mechanical tunneling of electrons
through the potential barrier of the junction (see Sections 2.4.4 and 5.4.1).
The tunneling process for reverse current is essentially the Zener effect,
although negligible reverse bias is needed to initiate the process in tunnel
diodes. As we shall see in this section, the tunnel diode (often called the
Esaki diode after L. Esaki, who received the Nobel Prize in 1973 for his work
on the effect) exhibits the important feature of negative resistance over a
portion of its I–V characteristic.
10.1.1 Degenerate semiconductors
Thus far, we have discussed the properties of relatively pure semiconductors; any impurity doping represented a small fraction of the total atomic
10.1
tuNNel DiODes542 Chapter 10
density of the material. Since the few impurity atoms were so widely spaced
throughout the sample, we could be confident that no charge transport
could take place within the donor or acceptor levels themselves. At high
doping, the impurities are so close together that we can no longer consider
the donor level as being composed of discrete, noninteracting energy states.
Instead, the donor states form a band, which may overlap the bottom of the
conduction band. If the conduction-band electron concentration n exceeds
the effective density of states Nc, the Fermi level is no longer within the
band gap, but lies within the conduction band. When this occurs, the material is called degenerate n-type. The analogous case of degenerate p-type
material occurs when the acceptor concentration is very high and the Fermi
level lies in the valence band. We recall that the energy states below EF are
mostly filled and states above EF are empty, except for a small distribution
dictated by the Fermi statistics. Thus, in a degenerate n-type sample, the
region between Ec and EF is for the most part filled with electrons, and in
a degenerate p-type sample, the region between Ev and EF is almost completely filled with holes.
A p-n junction between two degenerate semiconductors is illustrated
in terms of energy bands in Fig. 10–1a. This is the equilibrium condition,
for which the Fermi level is constant throughout the junction. We notice
that E
Fp lies below the valence-band edge on the p side, and EFn is above
the conduction-band edge on the n side. Thus, the bands must overlap on
the energy scale in order for EF to be constant. This overlapping of bands
is very important; it means that, with a small forward or reverse bias, filled
states and empty states appear opposite each other, separated by essentially
the width of the depletion region. If the metallurgical junction is sharp, the
depletion region will be very narrow for such high-doping concentrations,
and the electric field at the junction will be quite large. Hence, the conditions
for electron tunneling are met: filled and empty states separated by a narrow
potential barrier of finite height. In Fig. 10–1, the bands are shown filled to
the Fermi level for convenience of illustration, with the understanding that
a distribution is implied.
Since the bands overlap under equilibrium conditions, a small reverse
bias (Fig. 10–1b) allows electron tunneling from the filled valence-band states
below E
Fp to the empty conduction-band states above EFn. This condition
is similar to the Zener effect, except that no bias is required to create the
condition of overlapping bands. As the reverse bias is increased, EFn continues to move down the energy scale with respect to EFp, placing more filled
states on the p side opposite empty states on the n side. Thus, the tunneling
of electrons from p to n increases with increasing reverse bias. The resulting
conventional current is opposite to the electron flow—that is, from n to p.
At equilibrium (Fig. 10–1a), there is equal tunneling from n to p and from p
to n, giving a zero net current.
When a small forward bias is applied (Fig. 10–1c), EFn moves up in
energy with respect to EFp by the amount qV. Thus, electrons below EFnHigh-Frequency, High-Power and Nanoelectronic Devices 543
on the n side are placed opposite empty states above EFp on the p side.
Electron tunneling occurs from n to p as shown, with the resulting conventional current from p to n. This forward-tunneling current continues to
increase with increased bias as more filled states are placed opposite empty
states. However, as EFn continues to move up with respect to EFp, a point is
reached at which the bands begin to pass by each other. When this occurs,
the number of filled states opposite empty states decreases. The resulting
decrease in tunneling current is illustrated in Fig. 10–1d. This region of the
I–
V characteristic is important in that the decrease in tunneling current with
increased bias produces a region of negative slope; that is, the dynamic resistance dV/dI is negative. This negative-resistance region is useful in oscillators.

If the forward bias is increased beyond the negative-resistance region,
the current begins to increase again (Fig. 10–2). Once the bands have passed
each other, the characteristic resembles that of a conventional diode. The
forward current is now dominated by the diffusion current—electrons surmounting their potential barrier from n to p and holes surmounting their
potential barrier from p to n. Of course, the diffusion current is present in
the forward tunneling region, but it is negligible compared with the tunneling current.
The total tunnel diode characteristic (Fig. 10–3) has the general shape
of an N (if a little imagination is applied); therefore, it is common to refer to
this characteristic as exhibiting a type-N negative resistance. It is also called
a voltage-controlled negative resistance, meaning that the current decreases
rapidly at some critical voltage (in this case, the peak voltage Vp, taken at the
point of maximum forward tunneling).
The values of peak tunneling current Ip and valley current Iv (Fig. 10–3)
determine the magnitude of the negative-resistance slope for a diode of
given material. For this reason, their ratio Ip > Iv is often used as a figure of

merit for the tunnel diode. Similarly, the ratio Vp>Vf is a measure of the voltage spread between the two positive-resistance regions.
The negative resistance of the tunnel diode can be used in a number of
ways to achieve oscillation and other circuit functions. The fact that the tunneling process does not present the time delays of drift and diffusion makes
the tunnel diode a natural choice for certain high-speed circuits. However,
the tunnel diode has not achieved widespread application, because of its
relatively low current operation and competition from other devices.
In this section, we describe a type of microwave negative-conductance device
that operates by a combination of carrier injection and transit-time effects.
Diodes with simple p-n junction structure, or with variations on that structure, are biased to achieve tunneling or avalanche breakdown, with an a-c
voltage superimposed on the d-c bias. The carriers generated by the injection
process are swept through a drift region to the terminals of the device. We
shall see that the a-c component of the resulting current can be approximately 180° out of phase with the applied voltage under proper conditions
of bias and device configuration, giving rise to negative conductance and
oscillation in a resonant circuit. Transit-time devices can convert d-c to microwave a-c signals with high efficiency and are very useful in the generation of
microwave power for many applications.
The original suggestion for a microwave device employing transit-time
effects was made by W. T. Read and involved an n+@p@i@p+ structure such as
that shown in Fig. 10–4. This device operates by injecting carriers into the
drift region and is called an impact avalanche transit-time (IMPATT) diode.
Although IMPATT operation can be obtained in simpler structures, the
Read diode is best suited for illustration of the basic principles. The device
consists essentially of two regions: (1) the n+@p region, at which avalanche
multiplication occurs, and (2) the i (essentially intrinsic) region, through
which generated holes must drift in moving to the p+ contact. Similar devices
can be built in the p+@n@i@n+ configuration, in which electrons resulting from

avalanche multiplication drift through the i region, taking advantage of the
higher mobility of electrons compared with holes.
Although detailed calculations of IMPATT operation are complicated
and generally require computer solutions, the basic physical mechanism is
simple. Essentially, the device operates in a negative-conductance mode when
the a-c component of current is negative over a portion of the cycle during
which the a-c voltage is positive, and vice versa. The negative conductance
occurs because of two processes, causing the current to lag behind the voltage
in time: (1) a delay due to the avalanche process and (2) a further delay due to
the transit time of the carriers across the drift region. If the sum of these delay
times is approximately one-half cycle of the operating frequency, negative conductance occurs and the device can be used for oscillation and amplification.
From another point of view, the a-c conductance is negative if the a-c
component of carrier flow drifts opposite to the influence of the a-c electric field. For example, with a d-c reverse bias on the device of Fig. 10–4,
holes drift from left to right (in the direction of the field), as expected. Now,
if we superimpose an a-c voltage such that ℰ decreases during the negative half-cycle, we would normally expect the drift of holes to decrease also.
However, in IMPATT operation, the drift of holes through the i region actually increases while the a-c field is decreasing. To see how this happens, let
us consider the effects of avalanche and drift for various points in the cycle
of applied voltage (Fig. 10–5).
To simplify the discussion, we shall assume that the p region is very
narrow and that all the avalanche multiplication takes place in a thin region
near the n+@p junction. We shall approximate the field in the narrow p region
by a uniform value. If the d-c bias is such that the critical field for avalanche
E
a is just met in the n+@p space charge region (Fig. 10–5a), avalanche multiplication begins at t = 0. Electrons generated in the avalanche move to the
n+ region, and holes enter the i drift region. We assume that the device is
mounted in a resonant microwave circuit so that an a-c signal can be maintained at a given frequency. As the applied a-c voltage goes positive, more
and more holes are generated in the avalanche region. In fact, the pulse
of holes (dotted line) generated by the multiplication process continues to
grow as long as the electric field is above Ea (Fig. 10–5b). It can be shown
that the particle current due to avalanche increases exponentially with time
while the field is above the critical value. The important result of this growth
is that the hole pulse reaches its peak value, not at p>2, when the voltage
is maximum, but at p (Fig. 10–5c). Therefore, there is a phase delay of p>2
inherent in the avalanche process itself. A further delay is provided by the
drift region. Once the avalanche multiplication stops (vt 7 p), the pulse of
holes simply drifts toward the p+ contact (Fig. 10–5d). But during this period,
the a-c terminal voltage is negative. Therefore, the dynamic conductance is
negative, and energy is supplied to the a-c field.
If the length of the drift region is chosen properly, the pulse of holes is
collected at the p+ contact just as the voltage cycle is completed, and the cycle
then repeats itself. The pulse will drift through the length L of the i regionHigh-Frequency, High-Power and Nanoelectronic Devices 547
during the negative half-cycle if we choose the transit time to be one-half
the oscillation period; that is,

where f is the operating frequency and vd is the drift velocity for holes.1
Therefore, for a Read diode, the optimum frequency is one-half the inverse
transit time vd>L of holes across the drift region. In choosing an appropriate resonant circuit for this device, the parameter L is critical. For example,
taking vd = 107 cm>s for Si, the optimum operating frequency for a device
with an i region length of 5 mm is f = 107>2(5 * 10-4) = 1010 Hz. Negative

1In general, vd is a function of the local electric field. However, these devices are normally operated with
fields in the i region sufficiently large that holes drift at their scattering-limited velocity (Fig. 3–24). In this
case, the drift velocity does not vary appreciably with the a-c variations in the field.548 Chapter 10
resistance is exhibited by an IMPATT diode for frequencies somewhat above
and below this optimum frequency for exact 180° phase delay. A careful
analysis of the small-signal impedance shows that the minimum frequency
for negative conductance varies as the square root of the d-c bias current for
frequencies in the neighborhood of that described by Eq. (10–1).
Although the Read diode of Fig. 10–4 displays most directly the operation of IMPATT devices, simpler structures can be used, and in some cases
they may be more efficient. Negative conductance can be obtained in simple
p-n junctions or in p-i-n devices. In the case of the p-i-n, most of the applied
voltage occurs across the i region, which serves as a uniform avalanche region
and also as a drift region. Therefore, the two processes of delay due to avalanche and drift, which were separate in the case of the Read diode, are
distributed within the i region of the p-i-n. This means that both electrons
and holes participate in the avalanche and drift processes.
Microwave devices that operate by the transferred-electron mechanism are
often called Gunn diodes, after J. B. Gunn, who first demonstrated one of the
forms of oscillation. In the transferred-electron mechanism, the conduction
electrons of some semiconductors are shifted from a state of high mobility
to a state of low mobility by the influence of a strong electric field. Negative
conductance operation can be achieved in a diode2 for which this mechanism
applies, and the results are varied and useful in microwave circuits.
First, we shall describe the process of electron transfer and the resulting
change in mobility. Then we shall consider some of the modes of operation
for diodes using this mechanism.
10.3.1 the transferred-electron mechanism
In Section 3.4.4, we discussed the non-linearity of mobility at high electric
fields. In most semiconductors, the carriers reach a scattering-limited velocity, and the plot of velocity vs. field saturates at high fields (Fig. 3–24). In
some materials, however, the energy of electrons can be raised by an applied
field to the point that they transfer from one region of the conduction band
to another, higher-energy region. For some band structures, negative conductivity can result from this electron transfer. To visualize the process, let
us recall the discussion of energy bands in Section 3.1.
A simplified E(k) band structure for GaAs is shown in Fig. 10–6 for
reference; some of the detail has been omitted in this diagram to isolate the
essential features of electron transfer between bands. In n-type GaAs, the
valence band is filled and the central valley (or minimum) of the conduction
band at Γ(k = 0) normally contains the conduction electrons. There is a
set of subsidiary minima at L (sometimes called satellite valleys) at higher
10.3
tHe GuNN DiODe
2These devices are called diodes, since they are two-terminal devices. No p-n junction is involved,
however. Gunn effect and related devices utilize bulk instabilities, which do not require junctions.High-Frequency, High-Power and Nanoelectronic Devices 549
energy,3 but these minima are many kT above the central valley and are normally unoccupied. Therefore, the direct band gap at Γ and the energy bands
centered at k = 0 are generally used to describe the conduction processes
in GaAs. This was true, for example, of GaAs lasers, discussed in Section 8.4.
The presence of the satellite valleys at L is crucial to the Gunn effect, however. If the material is subjected to an electric field above some critical value
(about 3000 V/cm), the electrons in the central Γ valley of Fig. 10–6 gain
more energy than the 0.30 eV separating the valleys; therefore, there is considerable scattering of electrons into the higher-energy satellite valley at L.
Once the electrons have gained enough energy from the field to be
transferred into the higher-energy valley, they remain there as long as the
field is greater than the critical value. The explanation for this involves the
fact that the combined effective density of states for the upper valleys is
much greater than for the central valley (by a factor of about 24). Although
we shall not prove it here, it seems reasonable that the probability of electron
scattering between valleys should depend on the density of states available
in each case and that scattering from a valley with many states into a valley
with few states would be unlikely. As a result, once the field increases above
the critical value, most conduction electrons in GaAs reside in the satellite valleys and exhibit properties typical of that region of the conduction
band. In particular, the effective mass for electrons in the higher L valleys
is almost eight times as great as in the central valley because of the smaller
3We have shown only one satellite valley for convenience; there are other equivalent valleys for different
directions in k-space. The effective mass ratio of 0.55 refers to the combined satellite valleys.

band curvature, and the electron mobility is much lower. This is an important result for the negative conductivity mechanism: As the electric field is
increased, the electron velocity increases until a critical field is reached; then
the electrons slow down with further increase in field. The electron transfer
process allows electrons to gain energy at the expense of velocity over a
range of values of the electric field. Taking the current density as qvdn, we
see clearly that current also drops in this range of increasing field, giving rise
to a negative differential conductivity dJ>dℰ.
A possible dependence of electron velocity vs. electric field for a material capable of electron transfer is shown in Fig. 10–7. For low values of
field, the electrons reside in the lower (Γ) valley of the conduction band,
and the mobility (mΓ = vd>E) is high and constant with field. For high values of field, electrons transfer to the satellite valleys, where their velocity
is smaller and their mobility lower. Between these two states is a region of
negative slope on the plot of vd vs. ℰ, indicating a negative differential mobility dvd>dE = -o*.4
The actual dependence of electron drift velocity on electric field for
GaAs and InP is shown in Fig. 10–8. The negative resistance due to electron
transfer occurs at a higher field for InP, and the electrons achieve a higher
peak velocity before transfer from Γ to L occurs.
The existence of a drop in mobility with increasing electric field and
the resultant possibility of negative conductance were predicted by Ridley
and Watkins and by Hilsum several years before Gunn demonstrated the
4This is a rather crude approximation, since o* is not a constant, but varies considerably with field; the
negative dielectric relaxation time therefore changes with time as the domain grows.

effect in GaAs. The mechanism of electron transfer is therefore often called
the Ridley–Watkins–Hilsum mechanism. This negative conductivity effect
depends only on the bulk properties of the semiconductor and not on junction or surface effects. It is therefore called a bulk negative differential conductivity (BNDC) effect.
10.3.2 Formation and Drift of space charge Domains
If a sample of GaAs is biased such that the field falls in the negative conductivity region, space charge instabilities result, and the device cannot be
maintained in a d-c stable condition. To understand the formation of these
instabilities, let us consider first the dissipation of space charge in the usual
semiconductor. It can be shown from treatment of the continuity equation
that a localized space charge dies out exponentially with time in a homogeneous sample with positive resistance (Prob. 10.3). If the initial space charge
is Q0, the instantaneous charge is
Q(t) = Q0e-t>td (10–2)
where td = g>s is called the dielectric relaxation time. Because of this process,
random fluctuations in carrier concentration are quickly neutralized and
space charge neutrality is a good approximation for most semiconductors in
the usual range of conductivities. For example, the dielectric relaxation time
for a 1.0 Ω@cm Si or GaAs sample is approximately 10-12 s.
Equation (10–2) gives a rather remarkable result for cases in which
the conductivity is negative. For these cases, td is negative also and space
charge fluctuations build up exponentially in time rather than dying out. This
means that normal random fluctuations in the carrier distribution can grow
into large space charge regions in the sample. Let us see how this occurs in a
GaAs sample biased in the negative conductivity regime. The velocity–field

diagram for n-type GaAs is illustrated in Fig. 10–9a. If we assume a small
shift of electron concentration in some region of the device, a dipole layer
can form as shown in Fig. 10–9b. Under normal conditions, this dipole would
die out quickly. However, under conditions of negative conductivity, the
charge within the dipole, and therefore the local electric field, builds up as
shown in Fig. 10–9c. Of course, this buildup takes place in a stream of electrons drifting from the cathode to the anode, and the dipole (now called a
domain) drifts along with the stream as it grows. Eventually, the drifting
domain will reach the anode, where it gives up its energy as a pulse of current in the external circuit.
During the initial growth of the domain, an increasing fraction of the
applied voltage appears across it, at the expense of electric field in the rest of
the bar. As a result, it is unlikely that more than one domain will be present in
the bar at a time; after the formation of one domain, the electric field in the rest
of the bar quickly drops below the threshold value for negative conductivity. If
the bias is d-c, the field outside the moving domain will stabilize at a positive
conductivity point such as A in Fig. 10–9a, and the field inside the domain will
stabilize at the high-field value B. A small dipole forms from a random noise
fluctuation (or, more likely, at a permanent nucleation site such as a crystal
defect, a doping inhomogeneity, or the cathode itself), and this dipole grows

and drifts down the bar as a domain. The formation of stable domains is not
the only mode of operation for transferred electron devices. Nor is it the most
desirable mode for most applications, since the resulting short pulses of current
are inefficient sources of microwave power. Removal of heat is a very serious
problem in these devices. The power dissipation may be 107 W>cm3 or greater
(Prob. 10.5), giving rise to considerable heating of the sample. If the application
does not require continuous operation, peak powers of hundreds of watts can
be achieved in pulses of microwave oscillation.
One of the most common applications of electronic devices is in switching, which requires the device to change from an “off” or blocking state
to an “on” or conducting state. We have discussed the use of transistors in
this application, in which base current drives the device from cutoff to saturation. Similarly, diodes and other devices can be used to serve as certain
types of switches. There are a number of important switching applications
that require a device remain in the blocking state under forward bias until
switched to the conducting state by an external signal. Several devices that
fulfill this requirement have been developed, including the semiconductorcontrolled rectifier (SCR).5 These devices are typified by a high impedance
(the “off” condition) under forward bias until a switching signal is applied;
after switching, they exhibit low impedance (the “on” condition). The signal
required for switching can be varied externally; therefore, the devices can be
used to block or pass currents at predetermined levels.
The SCR is a four-layer (p-n-p-n) structure that effectively blocks current through two terminals until it is turned on by a small signal at a third
terminal. We shall begin by investigating the current flow in a two-terminal
p-n-p-n device and then extend the discussion to include triggering by a third
terminal. We shall see that the p-n-p-n structure can be considered for many
purposes as a combination of p-n-p and n-p-n transistors, and the analysis in
Chapter 7 can be used as an aid in understanding its behavior.
10.4.1 basic structure
First we consider a four-layer diode structure with an anode terminal A at
the outside p region and with a cathode terminal K at the outside n region
(Fig. 10–10a). We shall refer to the junction nearest the anode as j1, the
center junction as j2, and the junction nearest the cathode as j3. When the
anode is biased positively with respect to the cathode (v positive), the device
is forward biased. However, as the I–V characteristic of Fig. 10–10b indicates, the forward-biased condition of this diode can be considered in two
separate states: the high-impedance, or forward-blocking, state and the lowimpedance, or forward-conducting, state. In the device illustrated here, the
forward I–V characteristic switches from the blocking to the conducting state
at a critical peak forward voltage Vp.
10.4
tHe P-N-P-N
DiODe
5Since Si is the material commonly used for this device, it is often called a silicon-controlled rectifier.554 Chapter 10
We can anticipate the discussion of conduction mechanisms that follows
by noting that an initial positive voltage v places j1 and j3 under forward bias
and the center junction j2 under reverse bias. As v is increased, most of the forward voltage in the blocking state must appear across the reverse-biased junction j2. After switching to the conducting state, the voltage from A to K is very
small (less than 1 V), and we conclude that, in this condition, all three junctions
must be forward biased. The mechanism by which j2 switches from reverse bias
to forward bias is the subject of much of the discussion that follows.
In the reverse-blocking state (v negative), j1 and j3 are reverse biased and
j2 is forward biased. Since the supply of electrons and holes to j2 is restricted
by the reverse-biased junctions on either side, the device current is limited to a
small saturation current arising from the thermal generation of electron–hole
pairs (EHPs) near j1 and j3. The current remains small in the reverse-blocking condition until avalanche breakdown occurs at a large reverse bias. In a
properly designed device, with guards against surface breakdown, the reverse
breakdown voltage can be several thousand volts. We shall now consider the
mechanism by which this device, often called a Shockley diode, switches from
the forward-blocking state to the forward-conducting state.
10.4.2 the two-transistor analogy
The four-layer configuration of Fig. 10–10a suggests that the p-n-p-n diode can
be considered as two coupled transistors: j1 and j2 form the emitter and collector junctions, respectively, of a p-n-p transistor; similarly, j2 and j3 form the
collector and emitter junctions of an n-p-n transistor. (Note that the emitter
of the n-p-n is on the right, which is the reverse of what we usually draw.) In
this analogy, the collector region of the n-p-n is in common with the base of
the p-n-p, and the base of the n-p-n serves as the collector region of the p-n-p.
The center junction j2 serves as the collector junction for both transistors.
This two-transistor analogy is illustrated in Fig. 10–11. The collector current iC1 of the p-n-p transistor drives the base of the n-p-n, and the
base current iB1 of the p-n-p is dictated by the collector current iC2 of the
n-p-n. If we associate an emitter-to-collector current transfer ratio a with
each transistor, we can use the analysis in Chapter 7 to solve for the current i.

Using Eq. (7–37b) with c1 = cN for the p-n-p, c2 = cN for the n-p-n, and

i =
IC01 + IC02
1 - (c1 + c2) (10–5)
As Eq. (10–5) indicates, the current i through the devices is small (approximately the combined collector saturation currents of the two equivalent transistors) as long as the sum c1 + c2 is small compared with unity. As the sum
of the alphas approaches unity, the current i increases rapidly. The current
does not increase without limit as Eq. (10–5) implies, however, because the
derivation is no longer valid as c1 + c2 approaches unity. Since j2 becomes
forward biased in the forward-conducting state, both transistors become
saturated after switching. The two transistors remain in saturation in the
forward-conducting state.
10.4.3 variation of 5 with injection
Since the two-transistor analogy implies that switching involves an increase
in the alphas to the point that c1 + c2 approaches unity, it may be helpful to
review how alpha varies with injection for a transistor. The emitter-to-collector

current transfer ratio c is given in Section 7.2 as the product of the emitter
injection efficiency i and the base transport factor B. An increase in c with
injection can be caused by increases in either of these factors or both. At
very low currents (such as in the forward-blocking state of p-n-p-n diodes),
i is usually dominated by recombination in the transition region of the emitter junction (Section 7.7.4). As the current is increased, injection across the
junction begins to dominate over recombination within the transition region
(Section 5.6.2), and g increases. There are several mechanisms by which the
base transport factor B increases with injection, including the saturation of
recombination centers as the excess carrier concentration becomes large.
Whichever mechanism dominates, the increase in c1 + c2 required for
switching of the p-n-p-n diode is accomplished automatically. In general, no
special design is required to maintain c1 + c2 smaller than unity during the
forward-blocking state; this requirement is usually met at low currents by
the dominance of recombination within the transition regions of j1 and j3.
10.4.4 Forward-blocking state
When the device is biased in the forward-blocking state (Fig. 10–12a), the
applied voltage v appears primarily across the reverse-biased junction j2.
Although j1 and j3 are forward biased, the current is small. The reason for this
becomes clear if we consider the supply of electrons available to n1 and holes
to p2. Focusing attention first upon j1, let us assume that a hole is injected
from p1 into n1. If the hole recombines with an electron in n1 (or in the j1
transition region), that electron must be resupplied to the n1 region to maintain space charge neutrality. The supply of electrons in this case is severely
restricted, however, by the fact that n1 is terminated in j2, a reverse-biased

junction. In a normal p-n diode, the n region is terminated in an ohmic contact, so that the supply of electrons required to match recombination (and
injection into p) is unlimited. In this case, however, the electron supply is
restricted essentially to those electrons generated thermally within a diffusion length of j2. As a result, the current passing through the j1 junction
is approximately the same as the reverse saturation current of j2. A similar
argument holds for the current through j3; holes required for injection into
n2 and to feed recombination in p2 must originate in the saturation current
of the center junction j2. The applied voltage v divides appropriately among
the three junctions to accommodate this small current throughout the device.
In this discussion, we have tacitly assumed that the current crossing
j2 is strictly the thermally generated saturation current. This implies that
electrons injected by the forward-biased junction j3 do not diffuse across p2
in any substantial numbers, to be swept across the reverse-biased junction
into n1 by transistor action. This is another way of saying that a2 (for the
“n-p-n transistor”) is small. Similarly, the supply of holes to p2 is primarily
thermally generated, since few holes injected at j1 reach j2 without recombination (i.e., a1 is small for the “p-n-p”). Now we can see physically why
Eq. (10–5) implies a small current while c1 + c2 is small: Without the transport of charge provided by transistor action, the thermal generation of
carriers is the only significant source of electrons to n1 and holes to p2.
10.4.5 conducting state
The charge transport mechanism changes dramatically when transistor action
begins. As c1 + c2 approaches unity by one of the mechanisms described,
many holes injected at j1 survive to be swept across j2 into p2. This helps to
feed the recombination in p2 and to support the injection of holes into n2.
Similarly, the transistor action of electrons injected at j3 and collected at j2
supplies electrons for n1. Obviously, the current through the device can be
much larger once this mechanism begins. The transfer of injected carriers
across j2 is regenerative, in that a greater supply of electrons to n1 allows
greater injection of holes at j1 while maintaining space charge neutrality;
this greater injection of holes further feeds p2 by transistor action, and the
process continues to repeat itself.
If c1 + c2 is large enough, so that many electrons are collected in n1 and
many holes are collected in p2, the depletion region at j2 begins to decrease.
Finally, the reverse bias disappears across j2 and is replaced by a forward bias,
in analogy with a transistor that is biased deep in saturation. When this occurs,
the three small forward-bias voltages appear as shown in Fig. 10–12b. Two of
these voltages essentially cancel in the overall v, so that the forward voltage
drop of the device from anode to cathode in the conducting state is not much
greater than that of a single p-n junction. For Si, this forward drop is less than
1 V, until ohmic losses become important at high current levels.
We have discussed the current transport mechanisms in the forwardblocking and forward-conducting states, but we have not indicated how558 Chapter 10
switching is initiated from one state to the other. Basically, the requirement
is that the carrier injection at j1 and j2 must somehow be increased so that
significant transport of injected carriers across j2 occurs. Once this transport
begins, the regenerative nature of the process takes over and switching is
completed.
10.4.6 triggering mechanisms
The most common method of triggering a two-terminal p-n-p-n is simply to
raise the bias voltage to the peak value Vp. This type of voltage triggering
results in a breakdown (or significant leakage) of the reverse-biased junction
j2; the accompanying increase in current provides the injection at j1 and j3,
as well as the transport required for switching to the conducting state. The
breakdown mechanism commonly occurs by the combination of base-width
narrowing and avalanche multiplication.
When carrier multiplication occurs in j2, many electrons are swept into
n1 and holes into p2. This process provides to these regions the majority
carriers needed for increased injection by the emitter junctions. Because of
transistor action, the full breakdown voltage of j2 need not be reached. As
we showed in Eq. (7–52), breakdown occurs in the collector junction of a
transistor with iB = 0 when Mc = 1. In the coupled-transistor case of the
p-n-p-n diode, breakdown occurs at j2 when
Mp
c1 + Mnc2 = 1 (10–6)
where M
p is the hole multiplication factor and Mn is the multiplication factor
for electrons.
As the bias v increases in the forward-blocking state, the depletion
region about j2 spreads to accommodate the increased reverse bias on the
center junction. This spreading means that the neutral base regions on either
side (n1 and p2) become thinner. Since c1 and c2 increase as these base
widths decrease, triggering can occur by the effect of base-width narrowing.
A true punch-through of the base regions is seldom required, since moderate
narrowing of these regions can increase the alphas enough to cause switching. Furthermore, switching may be the result of a combination of avalanche
multiplication and base-width narrowing, along with possible leakage current
through j2 at high voltage. From Eq. (10–6), it is clear that, with avalanche
multiplication present, the sum c1 + c2 need not approach unity to initiate
breakdown of j2. Once breakdown begins, the increased numbers of carriers
in n1 and p2 drive the device to the forward-conducting state by the regenerative process of coupled transistor action. As switching proceeds, the reverse
bias is lost across j2 and the junction breakdown mechanisms are no longer
active. Therefore, base narrowing and avalanche multiplication serve only to
start the switching process.
If a forward-bias voltage is applied rapidly to the device, switching can
occur by a mechanism commonly called dv/dt triggering. Basically, this type
of triggering occurs as the depletion region of j2 adjusts to accommodateHigh-Frequency, High-Power and Nanoelectronic Devices 559
the increasing voltage. As the depletion width of j2 increases, electrons are
removed from the n1 side, and holes are removed from the p2 side, of the
junction. For a slow increase in voltage, the resulting flow of electrons toward
j1 and holes toward j3 does not constitute a significant current. If dv/dt is
large, however, the rate of charge removal from each side of j2 can cause the
current to increase significantly. In terms of the junction capacitance (Cj2) of
the reverse-biased junction, the transient current is given by
i(t) =

where v
j2 is the instantaneous voltage across j2. This type of current flow is
often called displacement current. The rate of change of Cj2 must be included
in calculating current, since the capacitance varies with time as the depletion
width changes.
The increase in current due to a rapid rise in voltage can cause switching well below the steady state triggering voltage VP. Therefore, a dv/dt rating
is usually specified along with VP for p-n-p-n diodes. Obviously, dv/dt triggering can be a disadvantage in circuits subjected to unpredictable voltage
transients.
The various triggering mechanisms discussed in this section apply to
the two-terminal p-n-p-n diode. As we shall see in the next section, the SCR
is triggered by an external signal applied to a third terminal.
The semiconductor-controlled rectifier (SCR) is useful in many applications,
such as power switching and various control circuits. This device can handle
currents from a few milliamperes to hundreds of amperes. Since it can be
turned on externally, the SCR can be used to regulate the amount of power
delivered to a load simply by passing current only during selected portions
of the line cycle. A common example of this application is the light-dimmer
switch used in many homes. At a given setting of this switch, an SCR is turned
on and off repetitively, such that all or only part of each power cycle is delivered to the lights. As a result, the light intensity can be varied continuously
from full to dark. The same control principle can be applied to motors, heaters, and many other systems. We shall discuss this type of application next,
after first establishing the fundamentals of device operation.
The most important four-layer device in power circuit applications is
the three-terminal SCR6 (Fig. 10–13). This device is similar to the p-n-p-n
diode, except that a third lead (gate) is attached to one of the base regions.
When the SCR is biased in the forward-blocking state, a small current

6This device is often called a thyristor to indicate its function as a solid state analogue of the gas thyratron,
a gas-filled tube that passes current when an arc discharge occurs at a critical firing voltage. In a manner
analogous to the gate current control of the SCR, this firing voltage can be varied by a voltage applied
to a third electrode.560 Chapter 10
supplied to the gate can initiate switching to the conducting state. As a result,
the anode switching voltage VP decreases as the current iG applied to the
gate is increased (Fig. 10–13b). This type of turn-on control makes the SCR
a useful and versatile device in switching and control circuits (Fig. 10–14).
To visualize the gate-triggering mechanism, let us assume that the device
is in the forward-blocking state, with a small saturation current flowing from
anode to cathode. A positive gate current causes holes to flow from the gate
into p2, the base of the n-p-n transistor. This added supply of holes and the
accompanying injection of electrons from n2 into p2 initiates transistor action
in the n-p-n. After a transit time vt2, the electrons injected by j3 arrive at the
center junction and are swept into n1, the base of the p-n-p. This causes an
increase in hole injection of j1, and these holes diffuse across the base n1 in
a transit time v
t1. Thus, after a delay time of approximately vt1 + vt2, transistor action is established across the entire p-n-p-n, and the device is driven
into the forward-conducting state. In most SCRs, the delay time is less than
a few microseconds and the gate current required for turn-on is only a few
milliamperes. Therefore, the SCR can be turned on by a very small amount
of power in the gate circuit. On the other hand, the device current i can be
many amperes, and the power controlled by the device may be very large.
It is not necessary to maintain the gate current once the SCR switches
to the conducting state; in fact, the gate essentially loses control of the device
after regenerative transistor action is initiated. For most devices, a gate
current pulse lasting a few microseconds is sufficient to ensure switching.
Ratings of minimum gate pulse height and duration are generally provided
for particular SCR devices.
10.5.1 turning Off the scr

state—can be accomplished by reducing the current i below a critical value

(called the holding current) required to maintain the c1 + c2 = 1 condition.
In some SCR devices, gate turnoff can be used to reduce the alpha sum below
unity. For example, if the gate voltage is reversed in Fig. 10–14, holes are
extracted from the p2 base region. If the rate of hole extraction by the gate is
sufficient to remove the n-p-n transistor from saturation, the device turns off.
However, there are often problems involving the lateral flow of current in p2 to
the gate; nonuniform biasing of j3 can result from the fact that the bias on this
emitter junction varies with position when a lateral current flows. Therefore,
SCR devices must be specifically designed for turn-off control; at best, this
turn-off capability can be utilized only over a limited range for a given device.

We saw in Section 10.5 that the SCR has difficulty in efficiently turning off the
device using the gate. We need to use additional circuitry to reduce the anodeto-cathode current below the holding current to change the SCR from the
conducting state to the blocking state. This is, of course, clumsy and expensive.
Hence, the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) was invented by
Baliga in 1979 to address this issue. This variation on the SCR can easily be
turned off from the conducting to the blocking state by the action of the gate.
This device is also known by several other names, such as conductivity-modulated FET (COMFET), insulated-gate transistor (IGT), insulated-gate rectifier (IGR), gain-enhanced MOSFET (GEMFET), and bipolar FET (BiFET).

The basic structure is shown for an n-channel device in Fig. 10–15. It
combines an SCR with a MOSFET that is able to connect or disconnect the
n+ cathode to the n- base region, depending on the gate bias of the MOSFET.
The MOSFET channel length is determined by the p region, which is formed
by diffusion of the acceptors implanted in the same region as the n+ cathode. In other words, the channel length is determined not by the lithography of the gate, as in a conventional MOSFET but rather by the diffusion
of the acceptors. Such a MOSFET structure is known as a double-diffused
MOSFET (DMOS). The DMOS device is essentially an NMOSFET.
The main part of the IGBT is the n- region, which acts as the drain of
the DMOS device. This is generally a thick (∼50 mm) epitaxial region with a
low doping (∼1014 cm-3) grown on a heavily p+@doped substrate that forms
the anode. The n- region can therefore support a large blocking voltage in
the “off” state. In the “on” state, the conductivity of this lightly doped region
is modulated (increased) by the electrons injected from the n+ cathode and
the holes injected from the p+ anode—hence the alternative name conductivity-modulated FET (COMFET). The increased conductivity allows the
voltage drop across the device to be minimal in the “on” state.
The I–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 10–16. If the DMOS gate
voltage is zero (or below the threshold voltage), an n-type inversion region
is not formed in the p-type channel region and the n+ cathode is not shorted
to the n- base. The structure then looks exactly like a conventional SCR that
allows minimum current flow in either polarity until breakdown is reached.
For positive anode-to-cathode bias VAK, avalanche breakdown occurs at the
n-@p junction, while for negative VAK avalanche occurs at the n-@p+ junction.
When a gate bias is applied to the DMOS gate, we see that, for positive
VAK, there is significant current flow (Fig. 10–17). The characteristics look
like that of a MOSFET, with one difference: Instead of the current starting
to increase from the origin, there is an offset or cut-in voltage of ∼0.7 V, as
with a diode. The reason for this can be understood by looking at the equivalent circuit in Fig. 10–17a. For small VAK up to the offset voltage, the structure
looks like a DMOS in series with a p-i-n diode made up of the p+ substrate

(the anode), the n- blocking region (the base), which is essentially like an
intrinsic region, and the n+ cathode. In this regime, there is negligible voltage drop across the DMOS device, and the p-i-n device is in forward bias.
The injected carriers from the anode and the cathode recombine in the nregion. As we saw in Chapter 5, for a diode dominated by recombination in
the depletion region, the I–V characteristics show an exponential behavior,
with a diode ideality factor of n = 2. Therefore, in this region, we get
IA
∝ exp(qVAK > 2kT) (10–8)
On the other hand, when VAK is larger than the offset voltage (∼0.7 V), the
characteristics look like that of a MOSFET, multiplied by a p-n-p bipolar
junction transistor gain term. The equivalent circuit in this region is shown
in Fig. 10–17b. In this regime, not all the injected carriers recombine in the
near-intrinsic n- region. The current they supply, which is essentially the
DMOSFET current IMOS, acts as the base current of the vertical p-n-p BJT
formed between the p+ substrate (anode), the n- base, and the p- channel of
the DMOS device. Hence, the current is now given by

The shape of the characteristics looks like that of the DMOS device.
This is the preferred mode of operation of the IGBT.
Finally, if the current levels are too high, the IGBT latches into a low
impedance state like that of a conventional SCR in the “on” state. This is
undesirable, because it means that the gate of the DMOS device has now
lost control.
The IGBT clearly incorporates some of the best features of MOSFETs
and BJTs. Like a MOSFET, it has high input impedance and low input capacitance. On the other hand, in the “on” state, it has low resistance and high
current-handling capability, like a BJT or an SCR. Because of these factors,
and because it can turn off more easily than an SCR, the IGBT is gradually
becoming the power device of choice, in place of the more traditional SCR.
Nanotechnology is sometimes defined as engineered objects in the length
scale of 1–100 nm with novel, useful properties. This nanoscale regime, sometimes also known as the mesoscale, lies between the microscale (∼microns)
and atomic/molecular scale (∼0.1 nm). When objects are shrunk from the
macro to microscale and beyond, they don’t just become smaller, but they
also behave differently. One way to appreciate this is if one considers the
fraction of atoms that lie at the surface of a sphere. For macroscopic or
microscopic dimensions, the vast majority of the atoms are found to lie in
the bulk of the sphere. As one enters the mesoscale, a substantial fraction
of the atoms are found to be at the surface, which very often have different properties than bulk atoms. In other words, at some point smaller isn’t
just smaller but “smaller is different.” On the other hand, if one considers
much smaller objects such as atoms/molecules, their properties belong to the
realm of quantum mechanics and chemistry. Now, if one considers clusters of
these atoms/molecules, as in a nanoscale object, because of collective effects
between these atoms, new properties can emerge that are not manifested by
the individual atoms. The physicist, Philip Anderson, eloquently described
this as “more is different!”
There are many nanoelectonic devices that are being investigated in
research labs. We will briefly discuss a few interesting examples which show
novel, nanoscale properties, according to the dimensionality of the nanodevice: zero-dimensional quantum dots, one-dimensional quantum wires and
nanotubes, and two-dimensional layered crystals such as graphene. Many of
the novel properties arise from the density of states of these low dimensionality systems discussed in Appendix IV.
10.7.1 Zero-Dimensional Quantum Dots
Zero-dimensional quantum dot systems have singularities in the density
of states, where N(E) varies as 1>E. These are sometimes called “artificial
atoms.” However, the analogy is not perfect. While atoms have a spherically
symmetric Coulomb potential, V(r) ∼ 1>r, leading to energy levels that vary
10.7
NaNOelectrONic
DevicesHigh-Frequency, High-Power and Nanoelectronic Devices 565
as 1>n2 [Eq. (2–15)], the confinement potential in quantum dots can be
approximated as a parabloic potential, reminiscent of simple harmonic oscillators, leading to equispaced eigen-energies in the quantum dot according
to the rules of quantum mechanics. Quantum dot confinement also leads to
an increase of the effective band gap, since the lowest eigenstates in the conduction and valence band are pushed up in energy, leading to an increasing
blueshift, as dot sizes are reduced. This can lead to a dramatic change in the
colors of quantum dots made of a certain semiconductor, simply by changing the dot size, with obvious applications in optoelectronics. For instance,
one can incorporate such quantum dots in the active regions of lasers, and
tune the emission wavelengths toward the blue, and sharpen the linewidths
compared to three-dimensional active regions. Quantum dots have also been
used in solar cells to engineer the aborption characteristics of the cells, and
match it better to the solar spectrum.
Quantum dots can be made by so-called top down approaches involving nanoscale lithography, followed by etching. Alternatively, bottom-up
schemes such self-assembled quantum dots can be formed using heteroepitaxy. As described in Chapter 1, if we grow a dissimilar semiconductor on
a substrate, if there is a lattice mismatch, it leads to strain in the epitaxial
layer. Generally, the initial layers are smooth, which is known as the layerby-layer Frank-Van der Merwe growth mode. As the layer becomes thicker,
often there is roughening of the epitaxial layer because of increasing strain—
this is known as the Volmer–Weber growth mode. If the lattice mismatch in
the heteroepitaxial system is large, it can lead to very rough morphology or
quantum dots forming on the surface of the substrate in a self-assembled
fashion. This is known as the Stranski–Krastanov mode, and is the preferred
mode of fabrication in many optoelectronic devices where precise location of
the dots is not critical. This avoids time-consuming lithography and etching,
and allows, for example, inclusion of quantum dots in the cavity of a laser to
sharpen the emission linewidth.
An interesting electronic application of quantum dots is in flash memories that we discussed in Section 9.5.2. Recall that electrons can be stored
in a non-volatile fashion in the floating gate of an MOS structure, and the
presence or absence of these electrons corresponds to digit bits 1 or 0. As
one scales down the sizes of these flash memory cells, it would be desirable
to scale down the thicknesses of the tunnel dielectric, in accordance with the
scaling laws we discussed in Section 6.5.9. However, one finds that if the tunnel
oxide is less than ∼8 nm, there are inevitably manufacturing “weakspots” in
the oxide which cause the stored electrons to leak away and not be retained
for the requisite 10 years or longer. If the continuous floating gate electrode is
replaced by an array of discontinuous quantum dots, and electrons are stored
in them, we can more aggressively scale down the tunnel oxide, and therefore
the memory cell. A weakspot in the tunnel dielectric might discharge electrons
in a quantum dot in the vicinity of the weakspot, but the vast majority of the
other dots which are electrically discontinuous would still retain the stored
electrons. This greatly improves the reliability of the flash memory cells.566 Chapter 10
10.7.2 One-Dimensional Quantum Wires
One-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires or nanowires are an attractive platform for making ultra-scaled MOSFETs. These can be viewed as
a natural evolution of the FinFETs or MuGFETs that we discussed in
Section. 6.6.3. Recall that having a gate wrapped around three sides of a
channel in a three-dimensional structure gives the gate better electrostatic
control of the channel potential compared to a bulk MOSFET, and leads to
better channel length scalability. In a nanowire MOSFET, the gate can be
wrapped all around the channel, leading to even better gate control than in a
FinFET. However, the drive current of an individual nanowire FET is generally low. Hence, one needs to make parallel arrays of these devices.
Just as with quantum dots, such quantum wires can be formed by top
down lithography and etching techniques, or by novel bottom up schemes.
One such bottom up scheme is known as the Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS)
approach, first developed by Wagner in the 1960s. In this scheme, one patterns metal catalysts such as Au to form quantum dots on a substrate. The
structure is then loaded into a chemical vapor deposition system, and appropriate precursor gases are introduced, with the substrate at a high enough
temperature that the Au metal catalysts melt. For example, to grow Si nanowires, silane (SiH4) is flowed in such that it dissolves in the molten Au catalyst dots. There is a supersaturation of Si in the Au, leading to an extrusion
of Si atoms as single crystal Si nanowires growing vertically on top of the Si
substrate, with the Au catalyst floating on top of the nanowire. At the end
of the VLS growth, the Au catalysts can be etched off. Fortunately, due to
the low solid solubility of Au in Si, there is negligible Au contamination of
the nanowires or the substrate. Vertical FETs can be made in the forest of
nanowires, or these nanowires can be harvested and subsequently laid down
flat on another substrate for subsequent device processing. Other precursors
such as germane for Ge nanowire growth, or III–V nanowires, can be grown
by VLS.
Another type of 1D system is the carbon-based nanotube. As we saw
in Chapter 1, carbon can be tetrahedrally bonded to four other nearest
neighbor carbon atoms via sp3 bonding, leading to diamond. But C can also
undergo sp2 bonding which leads to a planar structure, such as the sheets of
carbon atoms in graphite. This two-dimensional planar bonding arrangement
of carbon led to the first nanostructures in C, based on so-called buckyballs or fullerenes.7 These are spherical shells of carbon atoms reminiscent
of the quantum dots we described in the previous section. Fullerenes can be
elongated into a tubular structure, leading to carbon nanotubes [Fig. 10–18],
and FETs can be made in them. These have somewhat similar properties as
nanowire FETs, but there are interesting differences in the density of states
7The name buckyball or fullerene is based on the American architect Buckminister Fuller who developed
the iconic geodesic dome, which looks similar to these carbon zero-dimensional nanostructures.High-Frequency, High-Power and Nanoelectronic Devices 567
of these carbon-based materials. For instance, depending on precise angular
orientation of the carbon atoms in the cylindrical tube, which is known as the
helicity or chirality of the nanotube, they behave as semiconductors (which
are good for FETs), or metals (suitable for interconnects).
10.7.3 two-Dimensional layered crystals
We have already met two-dimensional systems such as two-dimensional electron gases (2-DEG) in the inversion layer of a MOSFET made in a threedimensional bulk crystal. Such quasi-two-dimensional systems are formed
through electrostatic confinement. Recently, there have been breakthroughs
in two-dimensional atomic crystals or layered materials.
Staying with the theme of carbon, it was shown by Geim and Novoselov
in 2004 that one can peel off individual sheets of sp2-bonded carbon atoms
from graphite, leading to two-dimensional atomic crystals called graphene.
One can also view graphene as carbon nanotubes which are sliced along the
axis of the cylinder, and flattened out into monoatomic sheets of carbon.
The unit cell of graphene consists of a hexagonal array of carbon atoms with
a unique linear bandstructure, E(k), shown in Fig. 10–18. This is obviously
different from the parabolic E(k) relationship seen in most semiconductors. We saw in Section 3.2.2 that the curvature of these parabolic bands
determines effective mass of the electrons and holes. By contrast, the linear
bandstructure in graphene is more reminiscent of the linear dispersion relationship of photons, which are known to have zero rest mass, and thus travel
at the speed of light, c. The carriers in graphene, in analogy with photons,
also have zero effective mass, and are known as massless Dirac fermions,
traveling at a group velocity determined by the slope of the E(k) dispersion

relationship discussed in Section 1.5. The conical E(k) surfaces are known
as Dirac cones. In graphene, electrons and holes travel at a so-called Fermi
velocity, which is 10* that of the saturation drift velocity in Si or most semiconductors. Clearly, this makes graphene an attractive platform for very high
speed devices such as rf transistors. Unfortunately, one sees from the band
structure in Fig. 10–18d, that there is no band gap between the valence and
conduction band. Hence, MOSFETs in graphene have high off-state leakage currents for the reasons discussed in Chapter 6, making graphene FETs
unsuitable for digital logic which demand high ON–OFF ratio.
This has led to interest in other two-dimensional layered materials
which are similar to graphene, but have a band gap. One class of such materials are the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Transition elements
include Mo, W, etc. while chalcogens in the periodic table are Column VI
elements such as S, Se, and Te. Transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2
have a hexagonal unit cell like graphene, and two-dimensional mono-atomic
sheet structure, but unlike graphene, have a band gap, making these materials attractive for short channel MOSFETs. One could think of them as SOI
scaled to the ultimate limit of atomic layer thicknesses.
Yet another set of two-dimensional layered materials which have
garnered interested recently are the topological insulators (TI) such as the
bismuth@selenide/telluride. This class of solids are insulating in the bulk, but
have Dirac cone metallic surface states, similar to graphene, but with a novel
twist. Remember that electrons have a quantum number called spin, which
can have values of {½, corresponding to spin “up” or “down.” Normally,
in most semiconductor devices we have equal populations of both spins.
The spin simply adds a factor of 2 in the density of states, but otherwise can
be ignored. When electrons orbit around the nucleus, they see an effective
magnetic field due to the orbital motion, and spin up/down electrons can
have slightly different energies in this magnetic field. (The split-off bands
shown in Fig. 3–10 are the result of such interactions.) On TI surfaces such
as Bi2Se3, due to strong spin-orbit interactions in heavy nuclei such as Bi,
the spin of the electron is locked orthogonally to the wavevector k, which
determines its orbital motion. In other words, if electrons moving to the left
on the TI surface have spin up, electrons moving to the right will have spin
down. Such intriguing physics may lead to novel nanoelectronic devices in
the future which will not only exploit the charge of the electron, but also its
spin, a nascent field dubbed spintronics, in analogy with electronics.
10.7.4 spintronic memory
Although spintronics based on semiconductors is a burgeoning field, spinbased ferromagnetic devices have been used for a long time in hard disks,
and more recently in spin transfer torque random access memory (STTRAM).
A brief discussion of ferromagnetism in solids is warranted to explain these
devices. Spinning electrons can be thought of as tiny, atomic magnets which
point up or down. Ferromagnetism is a magnetic state where a majority ofHigh-Frequency, High-Power and Nanoelectronic Devices 569
the electron spins point one way or the other, even without an applied external magnetic field (which would tend to orient the electron spins.)
As we have mentioned in Section 10.7.3, normally in solids spin up/down
electrons are equally likely to be found, and the density of states has a factor
of 2 spin degeneracy. We also saw in Chapter 3 that electrons, being fermions,
must have an overall wavefunction e(r, s), depending on position, r, and
spin, s, that is anti-symmetric. So, as shown in Fig. 3–2, if the spatial part of
the wavefunction is symmetric, the spins are anti-parallel, and vice versa. So,
in this case, since the symmetric (bonding) orbital is the lower energy state,
it is energetically favorable for spins to be anti-parallel, and the solid is not
ferromagnetic. Such solids are paramagnetic, with no permanent magnetism.
On the other hand, if free electrons are considered, which are not subjected
to a strong ion core potential as in Fig. 3–2, the anti-symmetric orbital (with
parallel spins) is energetically favorable because the electrons are further
apart on average and, therefore, there is less Coulomb repulsion. Since the
spins are parallel, it leads to ferromagnetism. So, what aligns the spinning
electrons in a ferromagnet is electrostatic Coulomb interactions, rather than
the much weaker magnetostatic interactions between the magnetic dipoles.
This larger effective field is known as the Weiss exchange field (because it is
driven by the anti-symmetry of electron wavefunctions when two electrons
are interchanged). As a result, in a ferromagnet, there is a higher of density
of states of the majority spins near the Fermi level (Fig. 10–19a).

(a) Spin-based memory. Depending on whether the “free” magnet on the right is parallel (anti-parallel)
to the “fixed” magnet on the left, we have a low (high) tunneling resistance corresponding to the two
memory states. (b) Phase change memory whose resistance changes depending on the crystallinity of
the chalcogenide.570 Chapter 10
This is the basis of a host of ferromagnetic spin-based memories. For
example, one can have a permanent fixed ferromagnet that always points up,
separated by a tunnel dielectric from a free magnet which can point up or
down. If the two magnets are aligned, there is a high density of initial states
and final states for majority spin electron tunneling near the Fermi level. This
corresponds to a low tunnel resistance, and could correspond to bit 1. (Spins
do not flip during the tunneling process.) On the other hand, if the free
magnet is anti-parallel to the fixed magnet, there is a mismatch between the
initial and final density of states for both types of spin, and the tunnel resistance will be higher, corresponding to bit 0. This is known as tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). This, and similar effects such as giant magnetoresistance
(GMR), are used in hard disk memories that are ubiquitous in computers.
These effects are also the basis of STTRAMs which offer a new type of
“universal” memory that might one day supplant all the other types of memory that we discussed in Chapter 9 (SRAM, DRAM, flash). In STTRAMs, to
write a bit 1, a current flows through the fixed magnet, which spin polarizes
the electrons along the majority spin direction. When an electron tunnels
into the free magnet, it transfers spin angular momentum to the free magnet,
applies a torque, and flips it to make it parallel to the fixed magnet. This sets
the STTRAM in the low resistance state (bit 1) during read operation. If the
polarity of the write current is reversed, the sign of the angular momentum
transfer to the free magnet is flipped, and it becomes anti-parallel to the fixed
magnet, setting it into the high resistance state (bit 0).
10.7.5 Nanoelectronic resistive memory
As we saw for STTRAMs, memory devices can be based on two resistance
states, corresponding to digital bits 1 and 0. In some sense, such memory
devices are simpler to make than logic transistors, where requirements, such
as ON–OFF ratios, etc., are much more stringent. In recent years, novel nonvolatile memories have been developed based on resistance changes. In resistive RAMs (ReRAMs), a dielectric such as high-k dielectric is sandwiched
between two metal electrodes. Flowing a high write tunneling current through
the dielectric can create defect trap states or charges in the dielectric, which
can modify its resistance. The phenomena are akin to what we discussed in
Section 6.4.7 in the context of I–V characteristics of SiO2. The precise details
of programming (called setting) and erase (re-setting) depend on the dielectric
used in ReRAMs, and the physics is still somewhat controversial. In titanium
oxide-based dielectrics, it is believed that the mechanism involves creation
and annihilation of a string of oxygen vacancies, which results in a resistance
change. Some dielectrics can be set and reset with unipolar pulses of different
amplitude, whereas others require bipolar pulses of opposite polarity. Resistive
RAMs are also known by a colorful name, Memory Resistor or memristor.
Typical changes in resistance in ReRAM are several hundred percent. The
challenge in these devices is demonstrating reliability in terms of repeated
cycling between the two resistance states, without suffering from TDDB.High-Frequency, High-Power and Nanoelectronic Devices 571
Another type of resistive memory, where the resistance difference
between states 0 and 1 is much higher than in ReRAM (factors of ∼105
are typical), is the phase change memory (PCM) (Fig. 10–19b). Here the
memory storage element is a glassy material, perhaps a chalcogenide such
as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST). The passage of an electric current through a heating
element such as TiN is used to quickly heat and quench the GST, making it
amorphous, which is a high resistance phase. Alternatively, it can be held in
its crystallization temperature range for some time, thereby switching it to
a low resistance crystalline state. Interestingly, phase change materials are
not a new idea. They have been used extensively in rewriteable RW compact
discs (CDs) as the storage medium. A laser makes the layer amorphous (low
reflectivity) or polycrystalline (high reflectivity) for optical storage of the
digital bits.
The field of nanoelectronics is still in its infancy. As the great Richard
Feynman said, “There is plenty of room at the bottom!”
10.1 High frequencies in the microwave regime can be obtained by negative differential resistance achievable by tunneling (Esaki diodes), transferred-electron
effects (Gunn diodes), or transit-time effects (IMPATT diodes).
10.2 High power switching is possible with p-n-p-n diodes, thyristors, or SCRs. These
devices can be understood in terms of two coupled BJTs. Similar effects in
CMOS cause latchup.
10.3 Modern power devices are based on the IGBT, which is a combination of an
SCR and a MOSFET.
10.4 Nanoelectronics is based on the mesoscale between the larger (microscale)
and smaller (atomic) dimensions where novel phenomena can be beneficially
exploited.
summary
10.1 Sketch the band diagram for an abrupt junction in which the doping on the
p side is degenerate and the Fermi level on the n side is aligned with the bottom
of the conduction band. Draw the forward- and reverse-bias band diagrams and
sketch the I–V characteristic. This diode is often called a backward diode. Can
you explain why?
10.2 What determines the peak tunneling voltage Vp of a tunnel diode? Explain.
If a large density of trapping centers is present in a tunnel diode (Fig. P10–2),
tunneling can occur from the n-side conduction band to the trapping level
(A–B). Then the electrons may drop to the valence band on the p side (B–C),
thereby completing a two-step process of charge transport across the junction. In fact, if the density of trapping centers is large, it is possible to observe
an increase in current as the states below EFn pass by the trapping level with
increased bias. In Fig. P10–2, the trapping level Et is located 0.3 eV above the
valence band. Assume that E
g = 1 eV, EFn - Ec on the n side equals Ev - EFp
on the p side, and both EFn - Ec and Ev - EFp equal 0.1 eV.

(b) Calculate the maximum forward bias for tunneling via Et.
(c) Sketch the I–V curve for this tunnel diode. Assume that the maximum
tunneling current via Et is about one-third of the peak band-to-band tunneling current.
10.3 (a) Write down the complete continuity equation and solve it. Find the excess
minority hole concentration as a function of time (t) for t Ú 0. Assume
that there is no applied field but recombination is present. Consider an
n-type Si sample with donor concentration as 1016/cm3 at T = 300 K. Due
to uniform illumination of light at t = 0, EHPs are generated at a rate of
1020/cm3. If minority carrier lifetime is 10 nsec, find the excess hole concentration at t = 5 msec.
(b) When the steady state excess hole concentration is 2 * 1014/cm3 as
t i ∞, estimate the minority carrier lifetime
(c) Determine the time at which the excess minority carrier concentration
becomes one third of the steady state value obtained in part (b).
10.4 Assuming that nΓ electrons>cm3 are in the lower (central) valley of the GaAs
conduction band at time t and nL are in the satellite (L) valleys, show that the
criterion for negative differential conductivity (dJ>dE 6 0) is
ℰ(oΓ - oL)

(Note: n0 = nΓ + nL.) Discuss the conditions for negative differential conductivity, assuming that the mobilities are approximately proportional to ℰ-1.

(b) Using data from Fig. 10–9a, calculate the power dissipated in the sample per unit volume when it is biased just below threshold if n0 is chosen

achieve the p-n-p-n switching action of Fig. 10–10.
10.8 In the p-n-p-n diode (Fig. 10–12a), the junction j3 is forward biased during the
forward-blocking state. Why, then, does the forward bias provided by the gateto-cathode voltage in Fig. 10–13 cause switching?
10.9 (a) Sketch the energy-band diagrams for the p-n-p-n diode in equilibrium, in
the forward-blocking state, and in the forward-conducting state.
(b) Sketch the excess minority carrier distributions in regions n1 and p2 when
the p-n-p-n diode is in the forward-conducting state.
10.10 Use schematic techniques such as those illustrated in Fig. 7–3 to describe the
hole flow and electron flow in a p-n-p-n diode for the forward-blocking state and
for the forward-conducting state. Explain the diagrams and be careful to define
any new symbols (e.g., those representing EHP generation and recombination).
10.11 In a coupled transistor model in presence of avalanche multiplication, the multiplication factor for the electrons is two times larger than that for the holes.
The emitter to collector current transfer ratio and the collector saturation current for the n-p-n transistor is four times than that for the p-n-p transistor. Find
the expression for the total current flowing through the device.

1Since cm is used as the unit of length for many semiconductor quantities, caution must be exercised
to avoid unit errors in calculations. When using quantities involving length in formulas which contain
quantities measured in MKS units, it is usually best to use all MKS quantities. Conversion to standard
semiconductor usage involving cm can be accomplished as a last step. Similar caution is recommended
in using J and eV as energy units.580

Defnitions of symbols: i is indirect; d is direct; D is diamond; Z is zinc blende; W is wurtzite; H is halite
(NaCl). Values of mobility are for material of high purity.
Crystals in the wurtzite structure are not described completely by the single lattice constant given here, since
the unit cell is not cubic. Several II–VI compounds can be grown in either the zinc blende or wurtzite structures.
Many values quoted here are approximate or uncertain, particularly for the II–VI and IV–VI compounds.
The gaps indicate that the values are unknown.
For electrons, the frst set of band curvature effective masses is the longitudinal mass, the second set the
transverse. For holes, the frst set is for light holes, the second for heavy holes.581
Appendix IV
Derivation of the Density of States
in the Conduction Band
In this derivation we shall consider the conduction band electrons to be
essentially free. Constraints of the particular lattice can be included in the
effective mass of the electron at the end of the derivation. For a free electron,
the three-dimensional Schrödinger wave equation becomes
-
U2
2m
∇2e = Ee (IV–1)
where e is the wave function of the electron and E is its energy. The form of
the solution to Eq. (IV–1) is
e = (const.)ej k # r (IV–2)
We must describe the electron in terms of a set of boundary conditions within
the lattice. A common approach is to use periodic boundary conditions, in
which we quantize the electron energies in a cube of material of side L. This
can be accomplished by requiring that
e(x + L, y, z) = e(x, y, z) (IV–3)
and similarly for the y- and z-directions. Thus our wave function can be
written as
en = A expc j 2Lp (nxx + nyy + nzz) d (IV–4)
where the 2πn/L factor in each direction guarantees the condition described
by Eq. (IV–3), and A is a normalizing factor. Substituting en into the
Schrödinger equation (IV–1), we obtain
-
U2
2mA∇2 expc j 2Lp (nxx + nyy + nzz) d
= EA exp c j 2Lp (nxx + nyy + nzz) d (IV–5)
Let us determine the number of allowed states per unit volume as a function
of energy [the density of states, N(E)] in various cases such as one, two, or582 Appendix IV
three dimensions. We first count states in k-space, then we can use the band
structure, E(k), to convert to N(E).
For the 3-D case in Eq. (IV–5), the components of the k-vector are
k
x = 2π nx/L, ky = 2π ny/L, and kz = 2π nz/L. Since there is one k-state for
every distinct choice of integer quantum numbers, (nx, ny, nz), the volume per
k-state is (2π)3/L3 = (2π)3/V, where V = L3 is the three-dimensional volume.
Hence, the number of states for 3-D in a k-space of Δk, taking into account
the factor of 2 spin degeneracy, is
e (2Lp3)3∆k f * (2) spin (IV–6a)
The number of states per unit volume for 3-D is
2
(2p)3 (∆k) (IV–6b)
In general, for p-dimensions we can generalize this expression as
Number of states per unit volume = 2
(2p)p (∆k) (IV–7a)
We can then transform from k-space to E-space using the E(k) bandstructure
relationship by setting
N(E)∆E = 2
(2p) p (∆k) (IV–7b)
As described in Section 3.2.2, the simplest band structure is parabolic:
E(k) = U2k2
2m* (IV–8a)
This is often a good approximation, particularly near the bottom of the conduction band or top of the valence band. Using this, we get the relation
between k and E as follows:
k = A 2mU2*E (IV–8b)
dk = eA m2* 1U f 21E dE (IV–8c)
For p = 3 we have the 3-D case, which is typical of bulk semiconductors. The
volume in k-space between two constant-k spherical surfaces at k and k + dk
is (Fig. IV–1a):
∆k = 4pk2dk (IV–9a)
neglecting terms with dk multiplied by itself.Derivation of the Density of States in the Conduction Band 583
The density-of-states then becomes:
N(E)dE = 2
(2p)3 4pk2dk = 2p22 amU2* b 3>2E 1>2dE (IV–9b)
We see that if we plot N(E) versus E, we get a parabolic density-of-states
function in 3-D for a parabolic band structure relationship (Fig. IV–2a).
For p = 2, we get a so-called 2-D electron gas (2-DEG) or hole gas. This
can arise, for example, in a quantum well (Section 3.2.5) or in the inversion
layer of a MOSFET.
In this case, the “volume” in k-space is the annular region between two
circles, k and k + dk, as shown in Fig. IV–1b, where
∆k = (2pk)dk (IV–10a)
again neglecting dk2.
Using Eq. (IV–7a), this leads to a density of states (per unit area)
N(E)dE = 2
(2r)2 (2rk)dk = rmU*2 dE (IV–10b)

We see that for 2-D, the density-of-states is a constant in energy, unlike
the parabolic density of states for 3-D (Fig. IV–2b). Actually, for the 2-DEG
in a quantum well or inversion layer (see Chapter 6) we must add the various
constant 2-D densities-of-states for the different “particle-in-a-box” levels
that were discussed in Sections 2.4.3 and 3.2.5, leading to a so-called “staircase” density of states.
For p = 1, we get 1-D quantum “wires.” These more esoteric structures
can be grown, for example, by MBE or MOCVD. In this case, the “volume”
in k-space in the region between k and k + dk in 1-D is (Fig. IV–1c):
∆k = 2(dk) (IV–11a)
Using Eq. (IV–7a), this leads to a density of states
N(E)dE = 2
(2p)1 (2dk) = p2U22mE* dE (IV–11b)
By examining the density of states in 3-, 2-, and 1-D [Eqs. (IV–9b),
(IV–10b), and (IV–11b), respectively] we notice a very interesting trend.
Every time we go to a lower dimensionality system, the dependence of density of states on energy changes by 1 > 2E. In fact, one finds that for 0-D
quantum “dots” the density of states is indeed proportional to 1/E. In the
1- and 0-D cases, we see that the density of states has singularities in energy,
which has very important implications for semiconductor devices. Such lowdimensional structures are discussed in Section 10.7.

To include the probability of occupation of any energy level E, we use
the Fermi–Dirac distribution function:
f (E) = 1
e (E - EF)>kT + 1 (IV–12)
The concentration of electrons in the range dE is given by the product of
the density of allowed states in that range and the probability of occupation.
Thus the density of occupied electron states Ne in dE is
Ne
dE = N(E)f(E)dE (IV–13)
For the 3-D case we may calculate the concentration of electrons in the
conduction band at a given temperature by integrating Eq. (IV–13) across
the band:
n = L0 ∞N(E) f (E)dE = 2p1 2 a2Um2 b 3>2e EF>kT L0 ∞E 1>2e-E>kTdE (IV–14)
In this integration we have referred the energies in the conduction band to
the band edge (Ec taken as E = 0). Furthermore, we have taken the function
f(E) to be
f(E) = e (EF - E)>kT (IV–15)
for energies such that (E - EF) ⪢ kT.
The integral in Eq. (IV–14) is of the standard form:
L0 ∞x1>2e-axdx = 2a22pa (IV–16)
Thus Eq. (IV–14) gives
n = 2 a2phmkT 2 b 3>2eEF>kT (IV–17)
If we refer to the bottom of the conduction band as E
c instead of E = 0,
the expression for the electron concentration is
n = 2 a2pmh2* nkT b 3>2e(EF - EC)>kT (IV–18)
which corresponds to Eq. (3–15). We have included constraints of the lattice
through the effective mass of the electron in the crystal, m* n.586
In this section, we will give a simplified derivation of Fermi–Dirac statistics.
We will not go through all the details, but will instead point out the physical assumptions involved. The distribution function is determined by calculating the number of distinct ways (Wk) we can put nk indistinguishable
electrons in gk states at an energy level Ek, subject to the Pauli exclusion
principle.
The assumptions are:
1. Each allowed state has a maximum of one electron (Pauli principle).
2. The probability of occupancy of each allowed (degenerate) quantum
state is the same.
3. All electrons are indistinguishable.
The number of distinct ways we can put the electrons in a particular level is
Wk =
(gk)(gk - 1)(gk - nk - 1)
nk! =
gk!
(gk - nk)!nk! (V–1)
For N levels in a band, the number of distinct ways we can put in the various
electrons gives us the so-called “multiplicity function,”
Wb = q
k
Wk = q
k
gk!
(gk - nk)!nk! (V–2)
If we ask, “What is the most probable distribution of the nk electrons in the
various Ek levels (degeneracy of gk in level Ek)?” the statistical mechanical
answer is:
In thermal equilibrium, the distribution which is most disordered
(i.e., has the maximum entropy, or which can occur in the largest
number of ways) is the most probable.
We therefore have to maximize Wb with respect to nk.
We assume here that the total number of electrons in the band is fixed.
ak
nk = n = constant 1 a
k
dnk = 0 (V–3)
Appendix V

We also assume that the total energy in the band is constant.
E
tot = a
k
Eknk = constant, implying a
k
Ekdnk = 0 (V–4)
To maximize or minimize some function f(xi) of q variables xi(i = 1, . . . , q)
subject to the constraints that g(xi) and h(xi) are constant, we use the method
of Lagrange undetermined multipliers.
We have
df = 0 (for extremal value of f ) (V–5)
dg = 0, dh = 0 (because g and h are constant) (V–6)
Introducing two Lagrange undetermined multipliers c and d, we get
ai
0
0xi
[ f(xi) + ag(xi) + bh(xi)]dxi = 0
0
0xi
[f(xi) + ag(xi) + bh(xi)] = 0 (V–7)
for i = 1, . . . q
g(xi) = const. h(xi) = const. (V–8)
We thus get (q + 2) equations in (q + 2) unknowns of (xi, c, d).
We apply this technique to our problem at hand. Instead of maximizing
Wb, we maximize ln Wb, because it makes the mathematics simpler. Since the
log function increases monotonically with the argument, maximizing one is
the same as maximizing the other.
ln Wb = a
k
[ln(gk)! - ln(gk - nk)! - ln(nk)!] (V–9)
To simplify these terms, we use Stirling’s approximation for factorials of large
numbers. ln x! = x ln x – x for large x.
ln Wb = a
k
[gk ln(gk) - gk - (gk - nk) ln (gk - nk) + (gk - nk) - nkln (nk) + nk]
= a
k
[gk ln (gk) - (gk - nk) ln (gk - nk) - nk ln (nk)] (V–10)
Now dgk = 0 because these are system constraints. We then get
d(ln Wb) = a
k
0[ln Wb]

dnk = a

ln angkk - 1bdnk = 0 (V–11)
Also, from the two constraints we get

dnk = 0 and a

Ekdnk = 0 (V–12)588 Appendix V
Then,
ak
c lnangkk - 1b - a - bEk d dnk = 0 (V–13)
ln angkk - 1b - a - bEk = 0 (V–14)
From this,

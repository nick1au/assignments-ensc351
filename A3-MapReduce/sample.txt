INTRODUCTION
he  world’s  population  is  rapidly  aging,  and  the
number  of  people  with  dementia  is  expected  to
grow  from  35  million  today  to  65  million  by  the  year
2030.  In  the  United  States  alone,  5  million  or  1  in  9
people   over   the   age   65   are   living   with   Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. For
comparison, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and  Prevention  (2009

2012  estimates),  about  3  million
older
adults
in
the
United
States
have
asthma,
10  million  have  diabetes,  20  million  have  arthritis,  and
25  million  have  hypertension.  Primary  care  physicians
and  specialists  alike  will  encounter  older  adults  with
dementia at an increasing frequency during their careers.
As dementia carries significant implications for patients,
their  families,  and  our  society,  it  is  imperative  for  well-
rounded physicians to have a solid understanding of this
topic.  The  purpose  of  this  review  article  is  to  provide
a  brief  introduction  to  AD  and  the  related  concept  of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The article emphasizes
clinical   and   neurobiological   aspects   of   AD   and   MCI
with   which   medical   students   should   be   familiar.   In
addition,  the  article  describes  advances  in  the  use  of
biomarkers  for  diagnosis  of  AD  and  highlights  ongoing
efforts to develop novel therapies.
ALZHEIMER’S  DISEASE
Alois  Alzheimer  and  Auguste  D
The German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Dr. Alois
Alzheimer  is  credited  with  describing  for  the  first  time
a  dementing  condition  which  later  became  known  as
AD. In his landmark 1906 conference lecture and a sub-
sequent  1907  article,  Alzheimer  described  the  case  of
Auguste D, a 51-year-old woman with a ‘peculiar disease
of  the  cerebral  cortex,’  who  had  presented  with  pro-
gressive memory and language impairment, disorienta-
tion,  behavioral  symptoms  (hallucinations,  delusions,
paranoia), and psychosocial impairment.

Remarkably,
many   of   the   clinical   observations   and   pathological
findings that Alzheimer described more than a century
ago continue to remain central to our understanding of
AD today.
Dementia
Dementia  is  a  clinical  syndrome  (a  group  of  co-
occurring signs and symptoms) that involves progressive
deterioration  of  intellectual  function.
4
Various  cogni-
tive  abilities  can  be  impaired  with  dementia,  including
memory, language, reasoning, decision making, visuos-
patial function, attention, and orientation. In individuals
with dementia, cognitive impairments are often accom-
panied by changes in personality, emotional regulation,
and  social  behaviors.  Importantly,  the  cognitive  and
behavioral  changes  that occur  with  dementia  interfere
with work, social activities, and relationships and impair
a person’s ability to perform routine daily activities (e.g.,
driving,  shopping,  housekeeping,  cooking,  managing
finances,  and  personal  care).  Table  1  summarizes  the
clinical criteria for all causes of dementia.
4,5
There  are  several  reversible  and  irreversible  causes
of  dementia.
4,6
Reversible  dementias  (also  referred  to
as  ‘pseudo-dementias’)  are  relatively  rare  but  poten-
tially treatable and occur secondary to another medical
condition, including depression, nutritional deficiencies
(e.g.,  vitamin  B12),  metabolic  and  endocrine  disorders
(e.g., hypothyroidism), space o
ccupying lesions (e.g., brain
tumor),  normal  pressure  hydrocephalus,  or  substance

abuse.   Certain  classes   of  medications  also  have   the
potential to cause cognitive impairment in older adults
(e.g.,  anti-cholinergics,  psychotropics,  analgesics,  seda-
tive-hypnotics). Irreversible (primary) dementias involve
neurodegenerative and/or vascular processes in the brain.
AD is the most common cause of irreversible dementia,
accounting  for  up  to  70%  of  all  dementia  cases  in  the
United States.
7
Other types of primary dementia include
vascular dementia (10

20%), dementia associated with
Parkinson’s  disease,  dementia  with  Lewy  bodies,  and
frontotemporal  dementia.
Epidemiology  of  AD
AD is a critical public health issue in the United States
and many other countries around the world, with a sig-
nificant  health,  social,  and  financial  burden  on  society.
An estimated 5 million Americans have AD, with a new
diagnosis being made every 68 sec.
8
In the United States,
AD  is  the  fifth  leading  cause  of  death  among  older
adults,  and  about  $200  billion  are  spent  annually  on
direct  care  of  individuals  living  with  dementia.  World-
wide,  it  is  estimated  that  35  million  people  have  AD
or other types of dementia, and about 65 million people
are expected to have dementia by 2030 (115 million by
2050).
9
AD  is  a  multifactorial  disease,  with  no  single  cause
known,   and   several   modifiable   and   non-modifiable
risk  factors  are  associated  with  its  development  and
progression.   Age   is   the   greatest   risk   factor   for   the
development of AD. The likelihood of developing AD in-
creases exponentially with age, approximately doubling
every  5  years  after  age  65.
10,11
The  vast  majority  of
individuals suffering from AD are aged 65 or older and
have  ‘late-onset’  or  ‘sporadic’  AD  (

95%  of  all  cases).
Rare  genetic  mutations  are  associated  with  the  devel-
opment of AD before age 65, which is known as ‘early-
onset’ or ‘familial’ AD (
B
5% of all cases).
12
People with
familial   forms   of   AD   have   an   autosomal   dominant
mutation  in  either  one  of  the  presenilin  genes  located
on chromosomes 1 and 14 or in the amyloid precursor
protein   (APP)   gene   located   on   chromosome   21.   In
addition, individuals with Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21)
have  an  increased  risk  of  developing  early-onset  AD.
The  genetics  of  sporadic  AD  are  more  complex  and
less  well  understood.  It  is  known  that  the  epsilon  four
allele  of  the  apolipoprotein  E  (APOE)  gene  located  on
chromosome  19  is  a  risk  factor  for  the  development
of sporadic AD.
13
The prevalence of AD is higher among
females,    reflecting    the    longer    life    expectancy    of
women.
14
Lower educational attainment has been asso-
ciated with increased risk of AD dementia,
10
consistent
with the idea that education serves to increase a person’s
cognitive  reserve  and  resilience  to  AD  pathology.
15
A
large  body  of  evidence  suggests  that  cerebrovascular
risk  factors  play  a  significant  role  in  both  the  develop-
ment  and  progression  of  AD;  people  with  a  history  of
diabetes,  hypertension,  obesity,  and  smoking  have  a
substantially  elevated  risk  of  AD.
16
Family  history  of
AD in first-degree relatives and a history of head injury
with  loss  of  consciousness  are  also  risk  factors  for  the
development  of  AD.
4
Neuropathology  of  AD
AD is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder
that   causes   a   significant   disruption   of   normal   brain
structure  and  function.  At  the  cellular  level,  AD  is  cha-
racterized  by  a  progressive   loss  of  cortical  neurons,
especially pyramidal cells, that mediate higher cognitive
functions.
17,18
Substantial  evidence  also  suggests  that
AD  causes  synaptic  dysfunction  early  in  the  disease
process, disrupting communication within neural circuits
important for memory and other cognitive functions.
19
AD-related degeneration begins in the medial temporal
lobe,  specifically  in  the  entorhinal  cortex  and  hippo-
campus.
20
Damage  to  these  brain  structures  results  in
memory  and  learning  deficits  that  are  classically  ob-
served   with   early   clinical   manifestations   of   AD.   The
degeneration  then  spreads  throughout  the  temporal
association cortex  and to parietal areas. As the disease
progresses,  degeneration  can  be  seen  in  the  frontal
cortex and eventually throughout most of the remaining
neocortex. Of note is the fact that AD causes pronounced

Clinical  criteria  for  dementia
1. Progressive impairment in two or more areas of cognition:
a) Memory (ability to learn and remember new information)
b)  Language  (speaking,  reading,  writing)
c)  Executive  function  (reasoning,  decision  making,
planning)
d) Visuospatial function (ability to recognize faces and objects)
e)  Praxis  (ability  to  perform  purposeful  movements)
f)  Changes  in  personality,  mood,  or  behavior
2.  Cognitive  deficits:
a) Interfere with functioning (ability to perform activities of
daily  living)
b)  Represent  a  decline  from  previous  levels  of  functioning
c)  Are  not  due  to  delirium  or  psychiatric  disorder  (e.g.,
depression)
d) Are established using history from patient, corroborated
by informant (e.g., family member), and objective cognitive
assessment

damage   to   multiple   components   of   the   limbic   sys-
tem,
12,21
including the hippocampal formation and the
major fiber tracts that connect it to the cerebral cortex
(fornix  and  cingulum),  amygdala,  cingulate  gyrus,  and
thalamus.  This  widespread  pattern  of  neurodegenera-
tion,   affecting   both   limbic   and   neocortical   regions,
correlates  closely  with  the  array  of  cognitive  deficits
and  behavioral  changes  that  AD  patients  exhibit.
12
In
addition  to  cognitive  impairment  across  multiple  do-
mains  (memory,  language,  reasoning,  executive,  and
visuospatial  function),  patients  with  AD  show  an  im-
paired  ability  to  perform  activities  of  daily  living  and
often experience psychiatric, emotional, and personality
disturbances.
It has been theorized that the neuronal damage seen
in AD is related to the deposition of abnormal proteins
both   within   and   outside   of   neurons.   These   are   the
hallmark  pathological lesions of  AD known as ‘plaques
and  tangles.’  The  abnormal  proteins  are  deposited  in
the cerebral cortex following a stereotypical pattern of
spread  along  neural  pathways  that  mediate  memory
and other cognitive functions.
18
‘Senile plaques’ are extra-
cellular  accumulations  of  amyloid  protein  and  consist
of  insoluble  amyloid-beta  protein  (A
b
).  Normally,  cells
throughout  life  release  soluble  A
b
after  cleavage  of
the APP

a cell surface receptor. AD involves abnormal
cleavage  of  APP  that  results  in  the  precipitation  of  A
b
into dense beta sheets and formation of senile plaques.
It is believed that microglia and astrocytes then mount
an  inflammatory  response  to  clear  the  amyloid  aggre-
gates, and this inflammation likely causes destruction of
adjacent  neurons  and  their  neurites  (axons  and  den-
drites).
11,18
‘Neurofibrillary tangles’ (NFT) are intracellular
aggregates of abnormally hyper-phosphorylated protein
tau,   which   in   normal   form   serves   as   a   microtubule
stabilizing protein and plays a role in intracellular (axonal
and vesicular) transport. It is possible that NFT interfere
with normal axonal transport of components necessary
for proper neuronal function and survival (e.g., synaptic
vesicles  with  neurotransmitters,  neurotrophic  factors,
and   mitochondria),   eventually   causing   neurons   to
die.
11,18
Substantial   evidence   supports   the   idea   that
amyloid formation and deposition in the cerebral cortex
is  one   of  the   earliest   pathological   processes   in  AD,
preceding  the  clinical  onset  of  the  disease  by  10

20
years.
12
Despite this, the temporal sequence of events in
the deposition of amyloid plaques and formation of NFT
during development of AD remains open to debate. In
fact, a recent study suggests that the initial formation of
NFT may occur in the brainstem rather than the medial
temporal lobe and may precede the appearance of the
first amyloid plaques in the neocortex.
22
Diagnosis  of  AD
The   gold   standard   for   the   diagnosis   of   AD   is   an
autopsy-based  (post-mortem)  pathological  evaluation.
The  presence  and  distribution  of  amyloid  plaques  and
NFT  in  the  brain  is  used  to  establish  the  diagnosis  of
‘definitive’ AD and stage the disease.
22
In clinical settings,
the diagnosis of AD is largely based on medical history,
physical and neurological examinations, and neuropsy-
chological evaluation, as well as the exclusion  of other
etiologies  using  selective  ancillary  testing.  The  clinical
diagnosis of AD has an accuracy of 70

90% relative to the
pathological  diagnosis,  with  greater  accuracies  being
achieved in specialty settings such as memory disorder
clinics.
23
The  cornerstone  of  the  clinical  diagnosis  is  a
set   of   consensus   criteria   first   established   in   1984
24
and  last  updated  in  2011  by  the  National  Institute  on
Aging

Alzheimer’s Association (NIA

AA) workgroup.
5
The NIA

AA clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ‘probable’
AD  dementia  are  summarized  in  Table  2.  When  the
patient’s   cognitive   impairment   has   an   atypical  clini-
cal course or is suspected to be due to other etiologies
in   addition   to   AD,   the   diagnosis   of   ‘possible’   AD
dementia  is  recommended.  Patients  with  AD  generally
have   normal   findings   on   physical   and   neurological
examinations.
6,25
To help with the differential diagnosis,
Table  3  summarizes  some  of  the  clinical  features  that
distinguish
AD dementia from other causes of irreversible dementia.
Laboratory  and  neuroimaging  studies  are  used  only
for  investigational  purposes  or  as  an  adjunct  to  the
clinical criteria for AD, particularly to rule out structural
brain lesions and identify ‘reversible’ causes of dementia.
The only laboratory studies that the American Academy
of  Neurology  recommends  to  be  performed  on  a  rou-
tine  basis  as  part  of  dementia  work-up  are  serum  B12,
thyroid  stimulating  hormone  (TSH),  and  free  thyroxine
Table  2.
Clinical  criteria  for  probable  AD  dementia
1.  Presence  of  dementia  (as  per  criteria  in  Table  1)
2.  Gradual  onset  of  symptoms  over  months  to  years
3.  History  of  progressive  cognitive  decline
4.  Initial  presentation  may  be  amnestic  (typical)  or
non-amnestic  (atypical)
5.  No  evidence  for  another  cause  of  cognitive  impairment:

(T4)  levels.

Structural  magnetic  resonance  imaging
(MRI) or non-contrast computed tomography (CT) may
be  useful  to  rule  out  normal  pressure  hydrocephalus,
cerebral hematomas, brain tumors, and cerebrovascular
lesions.
Treatment  of  AD
There  is  no  cure  for  AD,  and  drug  therapy  for  the
disease  is  still  in  its  infancy.  Approved  medications  for
the treatment of probable AD help control the symptoms
of AD but do not slow down the progression or reverse
the course of the disease itself.
12
At present, the mainstay
of  AD  therapy  are  drugs  that  target  neurotransmitter
systems in the brain. AD primarily damages glutamate-
and  acetylcholine-producing  neurons  and  their  asso-
ciated  synapses,  and  this  damage  correlates  well  with
early cognitive symptoms of AD.
19
Acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors  help  improve  memory  function  and  atten-
tion  in  AD  patients  by  interfering  with  the  breakdown
of  acetylcholine,  thereby  increasing  the  levels  of  the
neurotransmitter  at  the  synapse.  There  are  currently
three  FDA-approved  cholinesterase  inhibitors:
27
rivas-
tigmine
and
galantamine
(for mild to moderate AD), and
donepezil
(for  all  stages  of  AD).
Memantine
is  another
FDA-approved medication for use in moderate to severe
AD  but  belongs  to  a  different  class  of  drugs  known  as
NMDA (glutamate) receptor antagonists.
27
Both classes
of medications are generally well-tolerated, with gastro-
intestinal upset, dizziness, and headache being the most
common adverse effects observed.
In recent years, a number of potential disease-modifying
AD  drugs  have  been  evaluated  in  clinical  trials,  and
several  others  are  being  evaluated  in  ongoing  trials.
Drugs  that  act  to  decrease  the  amount  of  A
b
protein
in  the  brain  have  received  the  most  attention  due  to
the prominent pathogenic role ascribed to A
b
in the AD
literature.  One class of  such drugs are secretase inhibi-
tors,  which  inhibit  the  secretase  (protease)  enzymes
that  cleave  APP  to  produce  A
b
.
28,29
Another  strategy
that has been attempted is by using drugs that promote
the clearance of A
b
through active or passive immuniza-
tion.
30
Unfortunately,  as  of  the  writing  of  this  article,
several   completed   phase   three   trials   with   different
amyloid-lowering   drugs   have   failed   to   demonstrate
clinical  efficacy.
31
Various  explanations  have been  pro-
posed  to  account  for  the  repeated  clinical  trial  failures
observed   with   these   disease-modifying   agents.   One
possibility   is  that  A
b
may  play  a  less  prominent  or
different  role  in  AD  pathogenesis  than  previously  hy-
pothesized,
32,33
an  issue  certain  to  remain  controver-
sial  in  the  near  future.  Regardless,  other  therapeutic
strategies  for  AD  are  being  investigated  alongside  the
amyloid-based therapies, although with no major clinical
successes   yet   to   report.   A   promising   avenue   is   the
development   of   drugs  that   target  the   abnormal   tau
protein comprising the NFT.
31
Another important source
for  potential  AD  drugs  is  the  pool  of  medications  on
the market  that are  already  approved  for  non-AD  indi-
cations,  such  as  diabetes,  hypertension,  and  infectious
disease.  This  strategy  of  drug  ‘repurposing’  or  ‘reposi-
tioning’ can greatly expedite the discovery of novel AD
treatments  and  has  been  used  in  the  past  for  other
neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., anti-viral drug aman-
tadine  for  use  in  Parkinson’s  disease).
34
An  alternative
explanation for the clinical trial failures is that the trials
were  conducted  in patients with  mild to moderate  AD

dementia, at a stage when the disease process is likely
irreversible and brain damage is too great for the anti-AD
therapy   to   have   a   clinically   significant   effect.   Early
diagnosis  of  AD  and  timely  therapeutic  intervention  is
critical given that the disease may begin years or even
decades  prior  to  the  onset  of  dementia.
12,35
As  such,
greater  emphasis  is  being  placed  on  conducting  clini-
cal  trials  in  populations  of  persons  with  no  dementia
who  are  at  risk  for  developing  AD,  such  as  individuals
with MCI.
36
MILD  COGNITIVE  IMPAIRMENT
The  MCI  Concept
MCI  is  a  syndrome  characterized  by  memory  and/
or other cognitive impairments that exceed the decline
in cognition associated with the normal aging process.
MCI  is  often  regarded  as  a  precursor  to  dementia  or
a  transitional  state  between  healthy  cognitive  aging
and  dementia  (Fig.  1).
37
The  most  widely  used  clinical
criteria for the diagnosis of MCI are those proposed by
Petersen and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic (Table 4).
38
Researchers  have  also  proposed  several  subtypes  of
MCI   based  on  distinct   neuropsychological   profiles.
39
Amnestic  MCI  involves  memory-only  impairments,  while
non-amnestic  MCI  involves  only  impairments  in  cogni-
tive    domains    other    than    memory    (e.g.,    executive
function/attention, language, and visuospatial function).
Multi-domain  MCI  is  characterized  by  impairments  in
both  memory  and  non-memory  functions.
Epidemiology  of  MCI
Large population-based epidemiological studies
39

41
in  both  the  US  and  Europe  have  estimated  that  the
prevalence  of  MCI  among  adults  aged  65  and  older
is  3

24%,  with  higher  prevalence  in  older  individuals.
Prospective  longitudinal  studies  indicate  that  patients
with MCI exhibit annual rates of progression to demen-
tia of 3

15%, with highest rates for people in specialty
clinic-based  cohorts  as  compared  to  those  in  commu-
nity-based   cohorts.
42,43
Overall,   rates   of   progression
from  MCI  to   dementia  are  elevated   well  above  the
annual 1

2% incidence rate of dementia in the general
older   adult   population.
39
Among   MCI   patients   who
convert  to  dementia,  AD  is  the  most  prevalent  etiol-
ogy.
40
However, progression risks vary according to MCI
subtype; amnestic MCI and multi-domain MCI subtypes
progress more frequently to AD whereas non-amnestic
MCI  progresses  more  frequently  to  non-AD  forms  of
dementia, including vascular dementia.
39,41
Furthermore,
patients  with  multi-domain  MCI  have  a  greater  risk  of
developing AD than those with single-domain amnestic
MCI.
44
While  many  individuals  with  MCI  develop  de-
mentia, a substantial proport
ion remain cognitively stable
or  even  improve,  reverting  to  normal  cognitive  status
(Fig.  2).
41
Taken  as  a  whole,  epidemiological  research
suggests that MCI is a useful concept that describes the
pre-dementia stage of AD but that it is a heterogeneous
clinical  syndrome  in  terms  of  both  etiology  and  out-
comes.
39,45,46
BIOMARKERS  OF  AD  AND  MCI
Several    neuroimaging    and    other    biomarker    ap-
proaches  are  being  used  to  study  AD  and  MCI.  In  the
short  term,  biomarkers  of  AD  are  needed  to  improve
the  selection  of  patients  in  clinical  trials,  while  in  the
long  term  biomarkers  are  needed  to  identify  high-risk
patients   for   early   treatment   as   well   as   for   monito-
ring  disease  progression  and  response  to  treatment.
This    section    describes    some    of    the    widely    used
biomarker  approaches  and  the  related  findings  in  AD
and  MCI.

Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging
MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio frequency
waves  to  non-invasively  characterize  the  structure  of
the brain by measuring the energy released by protons
within various tissue components, such as gray matter,
white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Volumetric
MRI  has  been  used  to  study  regional  patterns  of  brain
atrophy in patients with MCI and AD.
20,47,48
Medial tem-
poral  lobe  atrophy,   involving  the  hippocampus  and
entorhinal  cortex  in  particular,  is  the  earliest  and  most
prominent   MRI   feature   evident   in   AD   and   predicts
progression from MCI to AD dementia.
49
On volumetric
MRI, AD patients also show marked enlargement of the
lateral ventricles, portions of which are adjacent to the
medial  temporal lobe.
50
Diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI)
is another MRI-based technique that, by measuring the
diffusion  of  water  molecules,  is  able  to  delineate  the
organization  of  white  matter  in  the  brain  and  allows
researchers to quantitatively assess the integrity of white
matter  fiber  tracts.
51
DTI  studies  have  shown  that  AD
and  MCI  disrupt  major  white  matter  pathways  in  the
brain, especially those within t
he limbic system (e.g., fornix
and  cingulum).
21,52
Finally,  functional  MRI  (fMRI)  is  a
neuroimaging  technique  that  indirectly  assesses  brain
function  by  measuring  blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(hemodynamic)  activity.  One  promising  application  of
fMRI (known as ‘resting-state’ fMRI) is the measurement
of  intrinsic  brain  activity,  which  occurs  irrespective  of
any  external  stimulation.
53
Resting-state  fMRI  studies
have  shown  that  AD  and  MCI  are  associated  with  de-
creased  communication  (functional  connectivity)  within
the  default  mode  network  (DMN),  a  network  of  brain
regions  involved  in  memory  and  internal  information
processing.
52
Positron  Emission  Tomography
Positron emission tomography utilizing 18F-fluorodeoxy-
glucose  (FDG-PET)  as  a  radioactive  tracer  is  a  nuclear
imaging   technique   which   measures   regional   brain
metabolism.  The  earliest  sign  of  AD  detectable  on  an
FDG-PET  scan  is  the  hypometabolism  of  the  posterior
cingulate cortex and precuneus.
54
This hypometabolism
is also detectable at the MCI stage of the disease.
55
FDG-
PET  has  also  proven  to  be  of  value  in  distinguishing
different  forms of  dementia, especially AD  versus fron-
totemporal   dementia.
55,56
A   recent   advance   is   the
development   of
in   vivo
PET-based   amyloid   imaging,
which  uses  a  special  radioactive  ligand  that  binds  to
amyloid  plaques  in  the  brain.  Pittsburgh  compound  B
(PiB) is a carbon-11-based amyloid-labeling ligand that is
widely  used  in  the  research  setting.  Patients  with  AD
show increased binding of PiB in temporal, parietal, and
frontal   brain   regions,   indicating   widespread   cortical
distribution of amyloid deposition.
57
The FDA approved
a different amyloid-labeling ligand, the fluorine-18-based
florbetapir, for clinical use in 2012.
58
PET-based amyloid
imaging is a novel and exciting diagnostic tool that non-
invasively detects one of the hallmark molecular lesions
of AD, but there remain several practical concerns about
its use in the clinical setting. In addition to its high cost,
there is a concern about the clinical utility of a positive
amyloid scan. While a negative amyloid scan appears to
rule out that a patient’s cognitive impairment is due to
AD (high negative predictive value), a positive amyloid
scan is much less informative because it can be positive
in  many  cognitively  normal  older  adults  and  people
with other non-AD neurological conditions (low positive
predictive  value).
59
For  now,  PET-based  amyloid  ima-
ging is not covered by Medicaid or Medicare for routine
clinical use in AD patients but only approved for limited
use  (e.g.,  to  rule  out  AD  or  for  selection  of  patients  in
clinical trials).
60
Fluid  Biomarkers
CSF-based  and  blood  plasma-based  protein  biomar-
kers  are  also  being  investigated  for  diagnosis  of  AD.
Several  studies  have  used  immunoassays  to  measure
the  levels  of  various  proteins  in  the  CSF,  finding  that
patients with AD show decreased levels of the 42 amino
acid  isoform  of  the  A
b
(A
b
-42)  peptide  and  elevated
levels  of  the  phosphorylated  tau  (P-tau)  peptide.
61,62
A recent longitudinal study showed that baseline A
b
-42/
P-tau   ratio   could   accurately   predict   the   progression

Clinical  outcomes  in  patients  with  mild  cognitive
impairment (MCI). Many patients with MCI eventually develop
dementia,  either   due  to  Alzheimer’s   disease  (AD)  or   other
causes  (e.g.,  cerebrovascular).  However,  a  substantial  propor-
tion  of  MCI  patients  stay  cognitively  stable  and  some  even
revert  to  normal  cognitive  status.

from  MCI  to  AD.
63
In  2007,  plasma  biomarkers  were
proposed as a promising alternative to CSF biomarkers
for  early  detection  of  AD.
64
In  recent  years,  other  stu-
dies have  examined  the  clinical  utility  of  cell-signaling,
immune,  metabolic,  and  disease-related  plasma  pro-
teins,  but  findings  have  been  inconsistent.

67
Overall,
furtherwork   must   be   done   to   standardize   the   mea-
surement  of  CSF  and  plasma  proteins  and  to  deter-
mine   the   clinical   utility   of   protein   biomarkers   for
diagnosis  of  AD.
CONCLUSION
Since  Alois  Alzheimer  described  the  first  case  of  AD
more than a century ago, much progress has been made
in understanding the biology and clinical aspects of the
disease.  Substantial  advances  have  been  made  in  cha-
racterizing pre-dementia stages of AD, such as MCI, and
improving the diagnostic and therapeutic options avai-
lable for managing AD. Our ability to find the ‘cure’ for
AD  ultimately  depends  not  only  on  having  an  accurate
view of the cellular and molecular processes that go awry
but  also  on having optimal  biomarkers  to enable  early
diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention in at-risk
individuals.  Recognizing  the  urgent  need  to  develop
clinically useful neuroimaging and other biomarkers for
the  early  detection  of  AD,  the  NIA  sponsored  the  on-
going    Alzheimer’s    Disease    Neuroimaging    Initiative
(ADNI) beginning in 2004.
62
The ADNI, which is akin to
the Framingham Heart Study in its ambitions, is a public-
private  partnership  and  the  largest  project  of  its  kind
that  seeks  to  collect  longitudinal  neuroimaging  data
along   with   clinical   data,   neuropsychological   assess-
ments,  and  biological  specimens  (e.g.,  blood  and  CSF)
from MCI, AD, and healthy older subjects. The ADNI and
similar large-scale initiatives are likely to rapidly advance
our  knowledge  on  dementia  and  AD  and  will  catalyze
the  development  of  significantly  more  effective  thera-
pies for AD than exist today. To conclude, the reader is
left with some important issues that must be resolved in
the future as we move toward a ‘cure’ for AD in the 21st
century:
(1)   What is the optimal combination of biomarkers for
(a) early detection of AD; and (b) monitoring disease
progression  and  response  to  treatment?
(2)   What   is   the   optimal   therapeutic   strategy   for   (a)
prevention of AD; (b) treatment of AD; and (c) spo-
radic versus familial AD? (i.e., therapeutic targets, role
of medications versus lifestyle modification, optimal
time to intervene)
(3)   What  are  the  potential  benefits  and  harms  asso-
ciated  with  shifting  the  therapeutic  strategy  from
(a) one that involves treating people with overt AD
dementia to (b) one where we treat people with MCI,
and ultimately to (c) one where we treat people who
are asymptomatic but show an AD-like biochemical
and/or imaging biomarker pattern? Are we  moving
closer to treating abnormal lab results as opposed to
the patient? For example, would we be abiding by
the oath to ‘first, do no harm’ by treating an asymp-
tomatic  person  who  shows  an  AD-like  biomarker
pattern  but  is  not  destined  to  develop  cognitive
impairment   (e.g.,   due   to   his/her   high   cognitive
reserve or resilience in the face of AD pathology).
